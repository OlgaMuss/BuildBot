ABSTRACT

Research Findings: This study aims to explore the optimal roles, pressing
challenges, and future developments of ChatGPT in early childhood educa­
tion (ECE) by interviewing six expert professors from China and the United
States. A content analysis approach that combined inductive and deductive
coding was employed to analyze the transcribed interviews. The findings of
this study revealed two primary roles of ChatGPT in ECE: (1) conversational
agent for young children and (2) on-call facilitator for educators and care­
givers. The challenges and risks associated with ChatGPT were categorized
using the ”3A2S” framework, which includes Accessibility, Affordability,
Accountability, Sustainability, and Social Justice. The participants suggest
that as knowledge, information retrieval, and integration skills become less
critical, human agency and inquiry ability become more important. As a
result, they predict that ChatGPT's future trajectory should be as a resource
for Intelligence Augmentation (IA) rather than as a replacement for the
actions of educators and caregivers. Furthermore, AI opens new domains in
ECE, such as AI literacy and AI social interaction, paving the way for novel
opportunities and challenges in the field. Practice or Policy: This study con­
tributes to the ongoing discourse on integrating AI technologies in ECE and
offers valuable suggestions for policymakers, educators, and caregivers.

The launch of ChatGPT in early 2023 changed the world overnight and dramatically provoked public
interest and global concerns about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the education sector
(Chen & Lin, 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2021; Su & Yang, 2023). This “ChatGPT Tsunami” has ignited our
hope for better education assisted by AI and awakened our fear of its uncertain impact on teachers and
learners. Optimists would underscore the fact that ChatGPT excels in tasks such as answering
questions and composing text and demonstrates a powerful capacity for intelligent conversation in
educational contexts (Dowling & Lucey, 2023; Mhlanga, 2023; Tate et al., 2023; Warr et al., 2023). This
is because ChatGPT could thoroughly enhance human education by offering personalized and
responsive AI support to learners and teachers (Atlas, 2023; Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023; Opara
et al., 2023) such as providing instant feedback, answering questions, and supplying resources
(Opara et al., 2023), marking assignments, and planning lessons (Cooper, 2023; Kasneci et al.,
2023). In contrast, pessimists tend to highlight its negative impacts on learning and teaching at all
levels, such as the proliferation of false information and biased viewpoints, violations of academic
integrity, loss of jobs, and further disparities in access that expand the digital divide (Communication

with Bing’s ChatGPT 4, April 25, 2023). To inform the following steps, empirical evidence is necessary.
This study draws on in-depth interviews with six experts to understand the optimal roles, pressing
challenges, and future developments of ChatGPT in early childhood education.
The Benefits of Integrating ChatGPT in Education
ChatGPT presents tremendous opportunities in the field of education (Kasneci et al., 2023; Su & Yang,
2023; Yan, 2023) that could be seized and capitalized to facilitate learning and teaching, respectively.
First, ChatGPT offers a wealth of opportunities for learning enhancement across all education levels,
catering to unique individual preferences, abilities, and needs (Kasneci et al., 2023; Su & Yang, 2023). It
may facilitate personalized learning experiences, supporting students in various aspects, such as
developing reading, writing, and critical thinking skills (Atlas, 2023; Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023;
Opara et al., 2023). Its large language models (LLMs) can aid in developing reading and writing skills
in primary school students; benefit secondary school students by tailoring practice problems, quizzes,
and problem-solving exercises; and leverage university students with better research and writing tasks
(Kasneci et al., 2023). Moreover, LLMs can empower learners with disabilities through speech-to-text
and text-to-speech integrations, providing inclusive learning strategies with appropriate support
(Kasneci et al., 2023). This has empowered ChatGPT to provide personalized support for students
of different ages and backgrounds. As Mhlanga (2023) points out, ChatGPT can design educational
plans and resources based on students’ language levels and subject characteristics, offering tailored
learning support. In addition, ChatGPT can adjust learning plans and course content according to
students’ learning history and performance, further assisting their learning journey (Qadir, 2022).
Second, ChatGPT also presents remarkable instruction opportunities, potentially revolutionizing
teaching practices and pedagogic approaches (Opara et al., 2023). For instance, by enabling the
creation of personalized learning experiences and tailored feedback, ChatGPT can alleviate teachers’
burdens and provide timely guidance for students to better grasp concepts and skills (Rospigliosi,
2023). Additionally, LLMs can automatically create teaching materials such as exercises, presentations,
and courseware, leading to increased efficiency in the teaching process (Rospigliosi, 2023).
Furthermore, ChatGPT can also generate study notes and knowledge summaries, offering students
a more comprehensive and diverse range of learning resources (Warr et al., 2023). Regarding
assessment, ChatGPT can automatically evaluate student work and responses, providing feedback
and suggestions that reduce teachers’ workload (Opara et al., 2023). This real-time feedback and
guidance not only help students grasp key concepts and skills more effectively but also enable teachers
to focus on other aspects of instruction that require their expertise (Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023).
Overall, applying ChatGPT in teaching practices can lead to more efficient and effective educational
experiences, strengthening teachers’ capacity and professionalism when used responsibly and sensibly.
The Challenges of Integrating ChatGPT in Education
Applying ChatGPT will challenge educational settings in the following domains: ethical and social
concerns, technical limitations and reliability, and human involvement and oversight. First, every
adoption of new technology is accompanied by ethical and social concerns, and ChatGPT is no
exception (Kasneci et al., 2023; Mhlanga, 2023). Recent studies have reported its ethical and social
challenges in educational contexts (Berson & Berson, 2023; Halaweh, 2023; Su & Yang, 2023; Tate
et al., 2023). The necessity for a significant amount of training data to ensure precise outputs (Yan,
2023) has brought about questions regarding the quality and inclusiveness of the data. This has
resulted in ethical concerns regarding potential biases in the training data and their impact on the
accuracy of the resulting outputs (Mhlanga, 2023; Su & Yang, 2023). In addition, many universities
have expressed their concerns about plagiarism and academic integrity issues, as students might
misuse these tools to complete assignments or assessments without fully understanding the concepts
(Rudolph et al., 2023). Furthermore, accessibility and the digital divide pose a challenge, as not all

EARLY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT

students may have equal access to advanced AI technology, exacerbating existing inequalities in
education (Iskender, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023).
Moreover, the technical limitations and reliability issues also present significant challenges for
ChatGPT in education. Ensuring the accuracy and dependability of AI-generated responses is essen­
tial, particularly as ChatGPT may struggle to understand students’ questions (Iskender, 2023) or may
inadvertently learn incorrect information (Rudolph et al., 2023). Privacy and data security are also
paramount, as sensitive student information must be safeguarded from potential breaches (BaidooAnu & Ansah, 2023). Additionally, the growing dependence on technology in education raises
concerns about students’ ability to develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking without over­
reliance on AI assistance (Kasneci et al., 2023).
Last but not least, the need for continuous human involvement and oversight remains a critical
challenge in implementing ChatGPT in educational settings. For instance, teachers must monitor and
guide the AI tool to ensure it continuously learns and adapts to different subjects and educational
scenarios (Iskender, 2023) while possessing sufficient language understanding and knowledge storage
to handle various questions and situations (Kasneci et al., 2023). This emphasizes the importance of
not replacing human educators with AI tools but instead integrating these technologies as
a supplement to enhance and support the educational experience. The balanced and responsible use
of ChatGPT and similar AI tools can lead to more effective and inclusive learning environments while
mitigating potential drawbacks (Chen & Lin, 2023).
The Objectives of This Study
Currently, there is limited evidence about the roles and functions of ChatGPT in the education field,
with most studies being conceptual and lacking empirical research. Among the few existing empirical
studies, some have investigated its application in various subjects and grade levels. Although current
ChatGPT studies, such as Cooper (2023) on science education and Atlas (2023) on higher education,
have explored the application of LLMs from both student learning and educator teaching perspectives,
there remains a scarcity of research on their use in early childhood education (ECE). However, prior
research on AI integration in early childhood education has demonstrated its usefulness and potential
benefits in various aspects (Chen & Lin, 2023; Su et al., 2023). AI enables tailored learning by utilizing
algorithms that analyze each child’s performance, capabilities, learning preferences, requirements, and
pace, providing customized learning experiences that address the child’s unique developmental needs
(Devi et al., 2022; Su & Yang, 2022). Furthermore, AI facilitates individualized, interactive support
through intelligent toys designed to recognize and respond to the child’s speech or inquiries, fostering
learning opportunities not available in conventional education (Kewalramani et al., 2021; Williams
et al., 2019). AI also enhances access to a broader range of learning experiences, as AI-powered
assistive technologies, such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and automatic speech recognition, offer
educational support for children with special needs or learning difficulties (Chen & Lin, 2023; Slavuj
et al., 2015). These findings imply that AI technologies, like ChatGPT, could be promising in the realm
of early childhood education. In addition, ECE has unique characteristics compared to other age
groups, including, but not limited to, the integration of learning content within a preschooler’s daily
life without clear subject boundaries; learning predominantly through play; and teaching encompass­
ing not only formal schooling but also a significant portion of family education (Li & Chen, 2023).
Exploring ChatGPT’s potential in this distinct age group is undoubtedly a valuable avenue for further
research. Therefore, this study is dedicated to exploring the optimal roles and functions of ChatGPT in
ECE, addressing its associated challenges and risks, and anticipating its future development. In
particular, the following research questions guided this study:
(1) What are the optimal roles and functions of ChatGPT in the ECE sector?
(2) What are the main challenges and risks of ChatGPT for ECE?
(3) What are the likely developmental trajectories for ChatGPT in ECE?

Methods
Expert Interview Method
A qualitative approach, the expert interview method, was employed to address the posed research
questions in this study. The expert interview method is a widely adopted research technique and is
capable of exploring or acquiring knowledge about specific areas of action (Döringer, 2021). This is
because an expert possesses technical, procedural, and interpretive knowledge in a specialized field
(Littig & Pöchhacker, 2014). Consequently, experts, as individuals engaged in the societal and political
aspects of life, often possess unique insights into particular issues or events (Littig, 2011). Moreover,
leveraging their expertise enables tackling fundamental challenges encountered in social science
research (von Soest, 2023). Therefore, the present study interviewed renowned experts from diverse
institutions, countries, and regions to explore the practical perspectives on ChatGPT and ECE
development from various standpoints.
Participants
To ensure the selection of representative cases, this study employed a purposive sampling method
(Suri, 2011) to choose participants who are education and technology professors working in China and
the United States and have used ChatGPT for more than two months. Accordingly, a convenience
sampling approach (Tracy, 2019) was utilized to select six experts (see Table 1) for individual inter­
views from four universities in China and USA by leveraging the researchers’ interpersonal network.
Expert participants were chosen based on their expertise in ECE and their knowledge of artificial
intelligence, which facilitated a more comprehensive exploration of the intersectional role of ChatGPT
in early childhood development. All six experts were informed of the purpose and nature of the study
before the interview and voluntarily agreed to participate. Since the experts reside in various countries
and regions, one-on-one online interviews were conducted with each of them at different times to
accommodate their schedules. This approach not only ensured the diversity of perspectives but also
allowed for a thorough examination of the potential and challenges of ChatGPT in the context of early
childhood education.
Interview Protocol
This study conducted semi-structured interviews focusing on the overarching question: “How can the
roles and functions of ChatGPT in early childhood education be optimized while addressing potential
challenges, risks, and future developments to ensure its effectiveness?” The interview protocol was

emailed to each participant one week before the interview so they could be prepared for the interview.
Then, the first author individually conducted web-based interviews using video conferencing software
with six participants. These interviews ranged from 45 to 79 minutes, with an average length of 65
minutes.
Interviews with the four Chinese participants were conducted in their native language –
Mandarin, while interviews with the two American participants were conducted in English.
Following the interviews, all six conversations were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Since the
participants and the authors were proficient in Mandarin and English, the initial coding process
was carried out separately for each language, closely adhering to the data (van Nes et al., 2010).
Subsequently, the Mandarin data were translated into English by four native Chinese speakers, and
an external translator verified the translations to enhance rigor. This research received ethical
approval from the first author’s university, and all participants’ names are pseudonyms to protect
their identities.
Data Analysis
The research team employed a content analysis approach (Saldaña, 2021) to analyze the inter­
view data, incorporating inductive and deductive coding methods. MAXQDA 2022 software was
used to facilitate a four-phase data coding approach, enhancing the analysis process’s accuracy
and reliability. In the first phase, the authors thoroughly read and reread the text data to
familiarize themselves with the content. During the second phase, key themes emerging from
the data were identified, and the third phase involved highlighting representative units of
information that best exemplified the identified themes. The fourth and final phase saw the
authors generating, selecting, or grouping categories using similar codes derived from the textbased data. The first author completed the four-phase data coding and the second author went
through the coding results thoroughly and independently. They discussed the discrepancies,
refined the codes accordingly, confirmed the final version with 100% agreement, indicating
a satisfactory inter-coder reliability.
Initially, the data were organized based on inductive analysis. In the interview, one participant
adopted the “3A2S” (Accessibility, Affordability, Accountability, Sustainability, and Social Justice)
framework (Xie & Li, 2020) to analyze the theme of ChatGPT’s challenges in early childhood
education. During the data analysis period, the first and second authors found that this framework
fitted the theme perfectly. Therefore, the research team decided to employ the “3A2S” framework to
deductively sort and align the codes accordingly. This comprehensive and rigorous approach to data
analysis ensured that the research findings were grounded in empirical data while also making
connections to frameworks (Mayring, 2014). Table 2 outlines the sorting and coding stages, showcas­
ing the culmination of the coding process, which resulted in the final coding scheme based on an
integration of inductive and deductive analyses (Saldaña, 2021).
A peer debriefing approach was employed to guarantee the reliability and credibility of the analysis
of coding results (Creswell & Creswell, 2017; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). In addition, four scholars,
including the two authors and two external researchers, collaborated to ensure the accuracy of the
analysis and verify the translation into English. Subsequently, the last author conducted an inquiry
audit (Creswell & Creswell, 2017) to provide an additional review, further confirming the trustworthi­
ness of the results.

The Multiple Roles and Functions of ChatGPT
This section delves into ChatGPT’s roles and functions for young children and educators or caregivers,
providing insights into its impact on early childhood education.
Conversational Agent for Young Children
All experts emphasized the role of ChatGPT in fostering contextual language development and
enhancing conversational social skills for young children from various angles, acting as
a conversational agent with several key functions.
To begin with, ChatGPT can provide age-appropriate conversations for young children. As
Professor I mentioned, “ChatGPT can explain concepts or words to children in a way they can
understand, adjusting explanations for different ages, such as a five-year-old, an eight-year-old,
and a twelve-year-old.” Meanwhile, ChatGPT can offer suitable conversation formats for young
children. For instance, Professor M described how ChatGPT could create a story in the style of
a famous children’s author, like Dr. Seuss, to help a child overcome their fear of a first airplane
trip.
Moreover, ChatGPT tirelessly answers children’s questions, catering to their curiosity. As Professor
P explained, “Children are natural questioners. Unlike parents or teachers who might become
frustrated after answering numerous questions, ChatGPT never gets tired or annoyed. Instead, it
greatly satisfies children’s curiosity, encouraging their love for asking questions, especially with the
development of voice-input interactions.” In addition, as Professor H pointed out, “ChatGPT can
provide children with necessary feedback and assistance anytime, anywhere. This real-time feedback is
akin to having an adult (agent) by the child’s side, ready to answer questions, engage in discussions, or
even participate in debates at any moment.”
Furthermore, ChatGPT contributes to the enhancement of conversational social skills. Through
interactive conversations, children can learn social cues, etiquette, and empathy, which are essential
for effective communication in real-life situations. As Professor I mentioned, “When discussing
ChatGPT’s role in social-emotional learning, we have seen opportunities to develop ‘social stories.’
These stories, generated by ChatGPT, help teach children social skills. Sometimes, we even use them to
create individual storybooks for children, which serve as reminders for self-regulation development.”

On-Call Facilitator for Educators and Caregivers
All experts emphasized the “facilitator” role of ChatGPT for educators and caregivers, noting that
while ChatGPT serves as a conversational partner and agent for young children, it acts as a 24-hour
on-call facilitator for early childhood educators and caregivers. For educators, such as teachers,
ChatGPT functions as an intelligent assistant. For caregivers, like parents, it acts as a constantly atthe-ready consultant.
Constantly On-Call Assistant for Educators. For educators such as preschool teachers, experts
discussed the various functions of ChatGPT as an intelligent assistant. One of the primary uses they
highlighted was that ChatGPT can act as a helpful assistant that is always available to teachers. For
example, ChatGPT can provide additional content knowledge to supplement teachers’ knowledge. As
Professor M mentioned:
One of the biggest concerns I’ve had ever since I started is that my students (pre-service teachers) don’t know
much about content knowledge to teach children, like history or geography. So, I’d rather have them go to
ChatGPT to help double-check what they’re thinking instead of making up something on their own and getting it
wrong. I’m not saying that ChatGPT is always right. But it might help them with their content knowledge.

Professor Y highlighted, “ChatGPT’s three main features are automation, search, and humancomputer interaction. However, the greatest innovation for school education in the short term is its
ability to produce diverse content, as the biggest need for many early childhood teachers is knowl­
edge.” He further explained, “Teachers may have studied professional subjects but may lack in-depth
knowledge to handle daily issues. ChatGPT can provide great convenience.” He also emphasized the
benefits of ChatGPT’s speed in consolidating information, saying, “Its ability to generate content faster
and create diverse content is impressive, something an individual teacher might struggle with.” As
Professor P succinctly put it:
ChatGPT allows every early childhood teacher to stand on the shoulders of experts, turning each one into an
expert themselves. You can ask it any question; although its knowledge is limited to 2021, it possesses a wealth of
information on early childhood education up to that point.

Additionally, ChatGPT can help reduce daily workload and increase teaching efficiency. Professor
P emphasized its role in assisting with lesson preparation, saying, “It can save teachers time by
providing them with valuable resources and information.” Professor I provided a detailed example
of how ChatGPT can generate lists of common misconceptions for teachers to address, explaining that
it can “save them time and allow them to focus more on planning their instruction.” Then, ChatGPT
can support teaching by generating new ideas and strategies. Professor Y suggested that it can “serve as
a heuristic method for teachers in the classroom,” while Professor M envisioned it playing a role in the
form of a generative AI device like an Echo Dot, used under teacher supervision, asserting that it
“could be a valuable addition to the classroom for classroom management and guidance.” Professor
I highlighted that ChatGPT could help teachers with predictive grouping, stating, “Imagine collecting
data on students, and you want to identify those who enjoy soccer in a class of 20. ChatGPT can
quickly analyze the data, allowing for preplanning and related activities. We haven’t done enough
experimentation with this yet.” This suggests that there is considerable potential for further explora­
tion of ChatGPT’s assistance in teaching. In addition, ChatGPT can help with administrative tasks.
Professor J mentioned how it can assist with mundane tasks like organizing and summarizing
materials, stating, “It can help teachers keep track of their resources and make better use of them.”
Professor H noted that it can also help managerial staff with tasks such as generating notices and
regulations, asserting that “ChatGPT can streamline many administrative processes.”
Moreover, ChatGPT can help teachers provide personalized and individualized guidance to young
children. For example, it can deliver tailored teaching based on a child’s interests, as Professor
I illustrated: “Suppose you met a little boy in class who was really excited about airplanes but had
a hard time keeping their attention. ChatGPT can create an engaging airplane adventure story to help

8

teach the child self-control.” Furthermore, ChatGPT can address the conversational needs of children
from families with special requirements, such as multilingual households, and facilitate dialogue
between homes and schools. As Professor M mentioned, “We find that ChatGPT allows teachers to
translate content into home languages, making it more accessible, which is relevant in our context.”
Professor I also highlighted this potential, stating, “If a preschool class in Shanghai connects with
a class in Florida, and a teacher wanted to teach the children to say ‘good morning,’ ChatGPT could be
used to generate the phrases and language needed, working in a translational space.”
Lastly, by relieving some of the pressures early childhood teachers face, ChatGPT enables them to
devote more time to enhancing their soft skills. Professors I and M saw ChatGPT as an assistant that
could help teachers focus on what really matters in their classrooms. Professor I explained how
ChatGPT can allow teachers to spend more time considering differentiating learning, saying that “it
frees up time for teachers to develop more effective learning strategies.” Professor M likened it to
having a teacher’s assistant with “superpowers,” adding that “it can help teachers manage their
workload more effectively.”
Constantly At-The-Ready Consultant for Caregivers. For caregivers such as parents, ChatGPT serves
as a constantly available consultant, offering a personal touch for parents to support their children’s
learning at home. Professor H said, “ChatGPT can help parents support their children’s learning at
home by providing resources, answering questions, and offering guidance on various educational
topics, fostering a supportive home learning environment.”
ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in helping parents communicate with their young children,
especially for those who may struggle with this task. As Professor I elaborated:
There are many parents who struggle with talking to their kids, even though they may excel in their own
professions. They might not know how to engage with their four or five-year-old child. ChatGPT, acting as an AI
agent, can help facilitate conversations between parents and children, similar to how family counselors teach
parents how to communicate with their kids. When used appropriately, it can be a powerful resource for parental
training and fostering meaningful conversations between parents and children.

Professor P believed ChatGPT to be a valuable assistant for parents, providing expert advice at their
fingertips. “ChatGPT offers on-demand expertise, giving parents answers to their questions, even if
they may not be able to judge the authenticity of the responses.” Professor P also suggested that
caregivers could benefit from a guidebook of prompts for using ChatGPT with children aged zero
to six.
In summary, whether it is helping children, teachers, or parents, ChatGPT essentially promotes
a shift in the educational model, adapting to digital transformation and moving from the traditional
“adult-child” binary structure to an “adult-child-AI” tripartite structure. This technology-empowered
tripartite structure has the potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of early childhood
education.
The “3A2S” Challenges and Risks
As mentioned earlier, the potential challenges and risks of ChatGPT could be framed into the “3A2S”
framework, which encompasses five key aspects.
Accessibility
Access Permission. Professors P, H, and J all mentioned the issue of access permission. Professor
J pointed out that “the impact on China is relatively small for now because, for various reasons, we
cannot use this product; we don’t have access permission.” Professor H added, “China is blocked as
a whole, but some universities, regions, and countries have chosen to ban its use within certain scopes
due to concerns about its effects on students’ performance or other factors.” Professor P further
explained, “Because accessibility divides the world into two groups: those who can use ChatGPT and

EARLY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT

9

those who cannot. Those who can are the successful group, while those who can’t are the losers.
Revolutionary technologies create this divide, and whether or not one can access them is a challenge
and issue.”
Young Children’s Access. For those who can access the technology, experts shared concerns about
young children using ChatGPT due to their age. To begin with, at its current stage, GPT requires
precise input while young children are still developing their language skills. As Professor I explained:
This is an interesting point concerning children, as we don’t see ChatGPT as a technological tool that is
necessarily appropriate for young children at this time. It is a language tool and resource that relies on the
precision of the prompts you input, so you have to be quite skillful. Even adults sometimes struggle to
communicate with ChatGPT to obtain the information they hope for. So, for children whose language might
not be their best modality for communication, they are still developing their language skills.

Moreover, young children need to develop their imagination before using technology. Professor
M asserted, “We all think that before children necessarily begin utilizing generative forms of artificial
intelligence, like ChatGPT, they themselves should be having opportunities to learn how to develop
their creative potential and their own sense of imagination.” Additionally, young children should not
become overly reliant on AI and should establish critical thinking skills. As Professor I explained, “We
don’t want children at a very young age to become overly trusting of the technology of the artificial
intelligence. . . because young children don’t yet have the capacity to do those things without guidance
and support.” Lastly, children may lack the background knowledge needed for high-quality interac­
tions with ChatGPT. Professor M mentioned, “The more contextual knowledge you have, the better
the responses you’re going to have from ChatGPT, so there’s an expectation.”
In summary, the potential challenges and risks associated with ChatGPT’s accessibility are multi­
faceted, particularly when considering its use among young children who are still developing their
language skills and facing other obstacles.
Affordability
Business Profitability. It is essential to balance the costs associated with AI development and
implementation with the need to maintain affordable access to AI tools for educational institutions
and users. As Professor J explained:
Technically, it is possible to achieve high computational power and fast response times. However, doing so would
require a significant financial investment. The challenge for businesses is to strike a balance between the necessary
computational power and the financial resources required to provide it. Therefore, it is fundamentally a question
of affordability.

In this quote, Professor J highlighted the importance of considering affordability when dealing with
the costs associated with AI development and implementation, emphasizing that businesses must find
the right balance between investing in computational power and ensuring accessibility for users.
User Affordability. Ensuring that the cost of using ChatGPT does not create a barrier for schools,
educators, and families who wish to integrate it into their early childhood education programs is
essential. Professor P stated, “It is important to ensure that the cost of using ChatGPT does not create
a barrier for schools, educators, and families.” Similarly, Professor Y emphasized, “We need to
consider the economic barriers that may prevent some families or schools from accessing AI tools
and develop strategies to ensure that cost does not limit access to quality education.”
Accountability
Human as Filters. Professor M emphasized the importance of human intervention and high­
lighted that, under the aspect of accountability, adults are the responsible parties for ChatGPT in
ECE. He stated, “Human beings should be the filter for ChatGPT, particularly when it comes to
young children.” He explained that although children are born skeptics, the power of new

10

W. LUO ET AL.

technologies like generative AI can make it difficult for them to maintain skepticism. Professor
M emphasized the need for teachers to exercise common sense when using such tools and
highlighted the importance of teaching children early on how to interact with these technologies
appropriately.
ChatGPT is known for generating fabricated answers, fake references, and nonexistent names.
Moreover, it has been criticized for generating biased and discriminatory content. Professor
I expressed this concern, saying,
One of the issues with ChatGPT and other generative AI is that they produce content that perpetuates certain
biases and prejudices. These AI models learn from the content available on the Internet, which can be proble­
matic due to the inherent biases and perspectives it contains. There is a need to find ways to safeguard children
from such content and prevent its dissemination.

Professors J and Y both acknowledged that the issue of falsehood in ChatGPT-generated content
could not be fundamentally resolved with recent technological innovations. Professor
J explained,
ChatGPT is a generative model, meaning that it predicts and generates answers based on the vast amounts of
language data it has been trained on. It does not have a mechanism for checking the truthfulness or accuracy of its
output, so it is not really a matter of whether it is fabricating information or not. To address the issue of veracity,
another model would be needed to evaluate the authenticity and accuracy of ChatGPT’s output, which is
a separate task.

Both Professor J and Professor Y highlighted the limitations of ChatGPT’s technology at this time.
Professor Y elaborated, “There is a contradiction in the current state of technology where
a language model must be both creative and precise in citing sources. It cannot achieve both
simultaneously.” To address these concerns, adults should progressively assist young children in
devising tactics for determining when AI is being deceptive. Professor H emphasized this point,
asserting, “It’s vital for adults to mentor children in creating methods to detect AI-generated
inaccuracies.”
Change in Assessment. Regarding accountability in evaluating quality, ChatGPT has emerged as
a critical factor in transforming the educational landscape. Considering the need for change in
assessment due to ChatGPT’s emergence, Professor I explained, “As the ‘genie is out of the bottle,’
we must recognize ChatGPT as a resource for students, just like calculators and the Internet, and adapt
our educational contexts accordingly.” The negative consequences of ChatGPT’s emergence, such as
students cheating or finding shortcuts, are concerns raised by Professor Y. However, Professor
H suggested, “The appearance of negative issues, like students using ChatGPT for assignments and
exams, should not cause excessive panic. On the contrary, the occurrence of such situations is an
excellent opportunity for us to reflect on, improve evaluation methods, and strengthen educational
management.”
Experts believed there might be three potential strategies for addressing the changes in assessment
methods brought about by ChatGPT. One approach, as described by Professor Y, is to completely
isolate AI by returning to traditional pen-and-paper exams. Professor J concurred, asserting that
“ChatGPT is like a very smart tutor, but it can’t help you during the exam.”
Another tactic entails concentrating on areas where current AI technology falls short, such as
answering context-specific questions, as mentioned by Professor Y. Professor H also advocated for
examining “human strengths through machine weaknesses.” What is more, Professor P proposed
a “reverse evaluation” approach. He suggested:
I even had a whimsical idea to ban ChatGPT, like some universities or as if taming a ferocious beast. Some
teachers worry about how to assess with ChatGPT, but if you ask me, I’d create an exam with a single question:
‘Please ask ChatGPT three questions.’ I don’t need the answers; I just want you to present the questions and
explain why you chose them. We could even base future assessments on ChatGPT’s responses and ask students to
consider what follow-up questions they should ask.

EARLY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT

11

Lastly, Professor Y proposed a human-AI collaboration, where students interact with AI to answer
questions and solve problems. He mentioned, “This method, somewhat similar to computerized
testing, has been employed in the assessment field for quite some time.”
While experts have yet to determine a definitive direction for the future of assessment reform, it is
clear that from an accountability standpoint, the emergence of ChatGPT will expedite the transforma­
tion of the current assessment system, gradually shifting the focus from knowledge-based evaluation to
a more comprehensive system.
Sustainability
Sustainability is an important aspect to consider when discussing ChatGPT. There are concerns about
whether it can sustainably support all countries and regions. Professor P mentioned, “With our large
population if ChatGPT were accessible to 1.4 billion people in China, its supercomputing capabilities
might collapse due to overload.” Sustainability also manifests in two other aspects: maintaining
children’s learning motivation and the boundaries of ChatGPT’s problem-solving capabilities in
early childhood education.
Learning Motivation Problem. Professor Y raised concerns about students losing motivation if they
can easily find answers: “If students can easily find answers, their motivation to attend classes might be
affected.” He further explained that ChatGPT is a powerful summary machine for acquiring knowl­
edge. Professor H agreed, stating, “ChatGPT’s precise answers may diminish children’s self-initiative
and weaken their learning motivation.”
However, Professor J had an opposing view, believing that the decline in learning enthu­
siasm is unrelated to ChatGPT. Instead, if properly guided, it may maintain and stimulate
learning enthusiasm. He explained, “I personally think that with a good AI tutor, learning
enthusiasm might not necessarily decrease. It depends on the teacher and their ability to
provide engaging tasks and methods, which may even increase young children’s learning
motivation.”
Problem-Solving Range in Limit. Regarding problem-solving depth, experts commented that
ChatGPT’s current content depth could provide a solid foundation but could not exceed that. As
Professor P explained:
It offers answers, ensuring teachers and some experts are on the similar level. This raises the baseline, elevating
everyone to a higher normal level. However, it cannot excel, as surpassing the level of these individuals is not
possible. AI brings benefits to early childhood curriculum, teaching, and teacher competence. When asked about
enhancing preschool teachers’ competence, ChatGPT delivers professional answers, but not highly creative or
high-end. To attain a top expert level, creativity and distinctive insights are necessary. My perspectives differ from
the mainstream, which is something ChatGPT can’t achieve. It can guarantee a baseline but cannot excel.
Dialectical thinking is another aspect, and though it’s worth exploring, its limitations stem from its database.
Reaching top expert level is impossible for it, but it can create, catch up, and learn, leading to rapid development.

From a sustainability perspective, the boundary of AI is that it can only assist humans and cannot
replace them. For young children, AI should not directly impact them but can only operate through
adult intermediaries. Technically, Professor J believed that technology would not be able to achieve full
interactivity in the short term, nor could it replace direct interactions such as parent-child and teacherchild interactions. He stated:
ChatGPT4 is multimodal but has limitations due to our innate human interactions. It’s challenging for machines
to learn and replicate human senses, as they perceive the world differently. Current models don’t account for
factors like hormones, making it difficult for them to mimic humans. Advancements in technology and under­
standing human cognition could help, but this generation of conversational robots isn’t there yet. The next
generation may achieve this, but the timeline is uncertain.

Regarding interactions between young children, Professor J said:

12

W. LUO ET AL.

It can simulate a peer, but a very dull, monotonous, and cold one. Even if it can say something that seems humanlike, it lacks other interactions, only offering natural language exchanges. I think the impact on children’s
development is significant, and I strongly advise against using such robots for excessive communication with
children. It’s like putting a human child among wolves – it’s not a good idea. AI can assist humans but cannot
replace human work.

In summary, from a sustainable education perspective, ChatGPT is far from matching human
intelligence and cannot compete with human teachers. On the one hand, human teachers possess
irreplaceable qualities. Education is a long-term interactive process that necessitates enduring highquality, sustainable interactions, with face-to-face conversations, emotional connections, and intellec­
tual exchanges between teachers and students being indispensable. On the other hand, in terms of
technological development, ChatGPT remains at a relatively low level. While the current ChatGPT can
integrate knowledge in specific areas or aspects, providing a baseline guarantee, there is still consider­
able room for improvement in processing unstructured information intelligently. This aligns with
experts’ opinion that ChatGPT can “only guarantee a baseline but cannot excel.”
Social Justice
ChatGpt Divide. Addressing social justice, Professor P highlighted the ChatGPT divide, saying,
“Accessibility creates two groups: those who can use ChatGPT, the ‘successful,’ and those who cannot,
the ‘losers.’ This divide raises concerns for social justice.” Additionally, Professor P elaborated on the
historical link between revolutions and class divisions, emphasizing that ChatGPT, a significant AI
product, will lead to industrial shifts and new class divisions. He compared the divide to an apocalyptic
Earth scenario, saying, “When the end comes, some can board ‘spaceship ChatGPT’ and leave Earth,
while many cannot, facing a different fate.” Professor J also observed, “Individuals who can use
ChatGPT effectively and avoid its pitfalls may gain a competitive edge in knowledge acquisition,
potentially learning faster and better.”
Ethical Concerns. ChatGPT’s ethical concerns also impact social justice. First, ChatGPT does not
disclose its data sources. As Professor I mentioned, “One of the issues with ChatGPT is that it does not
provide the sources from which it gathers information.” This creates three problems: uncertainty
about information accuracy, lack of credit to data providers, and automatic data collection on users,
including children.
Professor M explained, “ChatGPT doesn’t provide citations, so we can’t check the correctness of the
information or its source.” Furthermore, Professor I added, “People’s ideas and information are being
used by ChatGPT without giving them credit, and they don’t earn money for their creative content.”
This data collection on children also raises concerns, as Professor H noted, “It’s unclear how ChatGPT
stores and processes user interactions, leading to concerns about privacy, data security, and ethics.”
However, Professors M and I also mentioned that AI’s data collection on students could help adults
discover previously unnoticed issues and intervene promptly. Professor M said, “As data is collected
on children, AI could guide individualized learning or interventions children might need.” Professor
I added, “AI can sometimes pick up potential delays in children’s skill development before adults
notice due to its ability to collect vast amounts of data over time.”
Moreover, ChatGPT’s ethics primarily reflect Western cultural values, raising questions about
fairness for users in other regions. Professor Y said, “ChatGPT is ethically neutral, but its ethical
guidelines are imposed by its trainers, mainly from the US or white populations, which may not be
appropriate for other countries.” Professor I also mentioned cultural distinctions between countries
that could lead to limitations and concerns.
In conclusion, several participants emphasized that technology might act as a social accel­
erator, highlighting the importance of carefully utilizing it to reduce disparities and foster fairer
social development rather than exacerbating existing gaps between individuals and
communities.

EARLY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT

13

Perspectives on the Future: AI (Artificial Intelligence) or IA (Intelligence Augmentation)?
Historically, the introduction of calculators sparked concerns about students’ weakening computa­
tional abilities. However, in retrospect, calculators have revolutionized math education by making
certain knowledge less critical (e.g., basic arithmetic), emphasizing other areas as more important (e.g.,
statistics), and opening up new knowledge domains (e.g., complex geometry). This perspective can be
applied to ChatGPT as well.
Less Important Knowledge and Skills
In expert interviews, some knowledge and skills were thought to be important but turned out to be
less significant. Professor M mentioned, “With the advent of ChatGPT, people aren’t becoming
more ignorant, but rather less willing to spend time and energy on lifeless, cold factual knowl­
edge.” Professor H added, “Some knowledge and skills may become relatively less important after
the emergence of ChatGPT and other AI technologies, such as fact-finding, which involves using
search engines to locate factual information, since AI can provide fast, accurate answers.”
Professor J noted, “Basic information retrieval and integration skills are also less important now,
as the speed of acquiring information increases, making assessments of students’ information
retrieval skills less meaningful.”
More Important Knowledge and Skills
Certain knowledge and skills, such as critical thinking, data literacy, creativity, lifelong learning, and
interdisciplinary knowledge, have become more valuable. This study highlights two main points
mentioned by nearly every expert:
Human Agency. The experts emphasized the importance of human decision-making and responsibility
when using AI tools like ChatGPT to ensure that technology is used ethically and effectively in early
childhood education. More importantly, they highlighted the emotional aspect of interactions with young
children, whether in parent-child, teacher-child, or peer interactions. This emotional aspect is a crucial and
irreplaceable part of human agency in early childhood, becoming increasingly important. As Professor
I explained, “We should always prioritize early childhood relationships and ensure that AI technologies like
ChatGPT are used to optimize and focus on our human interactions and engagement with children, rather
than replacing them.”
Inquiry Ability. As previously mentioned by Professor P, the reform in assessment methods may shift
toward reverse questioning, making the ability to ask questions a vital skill. Professor I stated, “You
know, everything is about the prompt; ChatGPT only responds based on the way you ask the
question.” Professor Y added, “ChatGPT’s output depends on human prompts; it requires contextua­
lized, need-specific input. Using varied commands elicits diverse responses, honing inquiry and
description skills, and saving time.” Professor H noted,
Now, Prompt Engineering has become a hot new profession with annual salaries exceeding one million dollars.
How to ask questions, how to provide concise instructions, and how to cooperate with AI like chatbots will
become crucial skills that offer a significant advantage.

Professor P took it a step further, suggesting a shift from inquiry skills to planning skills:
Or, going even further, one should develop planning abilities, contemplating the next scenario, analyzing,
deconstructing, and then issuing commands to ChatGPT. This presents a challenge to a teacher’s intellect and
wisdom since our counterpart is ChatGPT, which is very smart. Thus, you need to improve your intelligence,
analytical planning, and guidance abilities, as well as your ability to ask well-planned and analytical questions. In
this way, you’ll be able to ask excellent questions.

Opening of New Domains
AI Literacy. Experts like Professors P and I stressed the importance of AI literacy. Professor
P introduced the concept of AI literacy, stating, “AI Literacy involves understanding AI, knowing
how to interact with it, discerning when to seek its help, and importantly, recognizing when it’s not
needed, especially for interpersonal communication and emotional aspects.” Professor I also empha­
sized its importance, “Really, what we’re finding with ChatGPT is that it almost requires a different set
of literacy skills.” Professor P further suggested, “We must enhance AI literacy for young children,
parents, and teachers alike. They must properly recognize and understand AI.” This emphasis on AI
literacy in early childhood education aligns with the findings of recent studies, such as Su et al. (2023)
and Su and Yang (2023), which also highlight the importance of developing AI literacy in ECE settings.
As the integration of AI technologies becomes more prevalent in education, fostering AI literacy
should be considered a priority area for future research and practice.
Al Social Interaction. All experts mentioned the concept of AI social interaction and human-machine
communication. The new generation must learn to communicate with robots. Professor Y said,
I can show you a screenshot of my conversation with a chatbot. It can discuss philosophical questions like ‘Why
are we alive?’ and ‘Are you living in a matrix?’ This is a human-machine interaction model. Our children may
need to learn new ways to communicate with machines.

Professor M mentioned AI-embedded toys, saying,
In the next few years, we’ll see AI-embedded dolls and toys that interact with children, helping develop both
cognitive and socioemotional skills. We might have AI-embedded dolls in classrooms, teaching socioemotional
skills as an example. Over time, as costs go down, more AI-embedded toys, games, and activities will be found in
unexpected places.

Professor P discussed AI social norms, saying, “With AI, we need to establish new AI ethics for
interactions and social rules between humans and AI. Parents and teachers should cultivate AI ethics
in children. We need to create a protocol of AI social norms.”
Rebuilding Digital Ecology. The impact of ChatGPT on education can be divided into superficial and
profound effects. This article mainly discusses the superficial impact, which revolves around the
transformation of knowledge production. For example, ChatGPT assists with knowledge acquisition
and information integration, leveraging its exceptional conversational and content generation cap­
abilities. This can be applied to intelligent tutoring systems and teacher assistance to enhance the
quality and efficiency of education.
However, the profound impact challenges the entire education system and is a more pressing issue
for future discussions. For instance, as ChatGPT can replace many entry-level knowledge tasks, what
knowledge and skills will future talents need? How should educational systems adapt regarding
curriculum design, teaching methods, and course offerings? This is what Professor P referred to as
“Rebuilding Digital Ecology.”
In conclusion, Professor I stated, “It would be better to refer to ChatGPT as intelligence augmentation
(IA), augmenting our human intelligence, as opposed to the technology becoming intelligent.” AI can serve
as an assistant to teachers, administrators, and parents but cannot replace human educators. AI can only act
according to human-set objectives and obey human commands, replacing humans in knowledge manage­
ment tasks. The initiation of these tasks comes from humans and can be stopped at any time according to
human will. Therefore, it is a resource for Intelligence Augmentation (IA), not a replacement for educators’
and caregivers’ actions.

Limitations and Implications
This study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. The first
limitation is that the expert interviews were conducted between late March and early April, which

EARLY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT

15

coincided with the release of GPT-4. As a result, the entire ChatGPT discussion was based on the
ChatGPT Mar 23 Version and did not include any discussions about potential subsequent technolo­
gical iterations. This limitation may affect the findings by not capturing the latest advancements in
ChatGPT technology. The second limitation relates to the choice of the expert interview methodology.
Although expert interviews are considered an effective empirical method for revealing internal
practical knowledge (Bogner et al., 2009; Döringer, 2021; von Soest, 2023), a primary weakness of
this approach is that the opinions expressed by the experts may not be neutral, leading to potential
biases. Further research could strengthen these findings by incorporating more data sources to address
these limitations. The third limitation of this study is the inherent subjectivity in qualitative data
analysis. To address this, multiple researchers were involved in coding and analysis, followed by
consensus-building. However, future research may consider methodological triangulation for greater
trustworthiness.
Considering the implications of ChatGPT in early childhood education, it is crucial to provide
valuable suggestions for policymakers, educators, and caregivers in the field to maximize the benefits
and minimize the risks associated with this technology. First and foremost, policymakers, educators,
and caregivers in the field should adopt an open-minded attitude and accurately recognize the value
and risks of AI. Education is known for its unique challenges, and countless new issues arise whenever
new technologies are introduced into educational practices. Facing the emerging contradictions
brought by ChatGPT in teaching, it is crucial not to resort to simple and crude blocking measures.
The relationship between humans and ChatGPT is not adversarial but rather one of mutual achieve­
ment. An open, rational, and positive attitude should be upheld in education. The Chinese proverb
says, “The wise are good at utilizing things and tools.” The future belongs to those who are open and
skillful in using technology and tools. To facilitate this, educational institutions could provide training
programs for educators to learn about AI applications, including ChatGPT, and their potential use in
teaching practices. In addition, workshops and seminars could be organized for educators to share
their experiences and best practices in implementing AI tools in the classroom.
Secondly, as educators, we should have complete confidence that AI will not replace teachers,
especially early childhood educators. Education involves emotions, imagination, respect, and indivi­
duality. Many times, education does not require scientific precision but instead pursues humanistic
ambiguity. For example, ChatGPT excels in solving problems like ”1 coin +1 coin = 2 coins‘ but is
powerless in answering whether ’1 life +1 life can equal 2 lives.” To illustrate this, schools can create
curricula that emphasize the unique skills of educators, such as AI literacy and Al Social Interaction,
while integrating AI as a complementary tool.
Thirdly, education cannot rely solely on the “input-output” approach to solve problems. As
previously mentioned, the unique skills and qualities that early childhood educators bring to the
classroom and children’s experiences make teachers invaluable and irreplaceable. Nonetheless, AI
does offer the benefit of an intelligence augmentation tool to further enhance instruction, and future
development in the field of early childhood will be influenced by trends in human-technology
collaboration. Early childhood educators who develop proficiency in utilizing AI technology and
skillfully integrate it into their teaching practices will be able to unlock new levels of effectiveness and
efficiency in their work. The benefits of AI in the field of early childhood education are numerous, and
practitioners who embrace this technology will be well-positioned to help their students thrive in
a rapidly evolving world.
Last but not least, to address the challenges and risks associated with ChatGPT in early
childhood education, policymakers should consider the following integrated approach: Improve
accessibility by focusing on the popularization and application of ChatGPT, especially in early
childhood education, and develop related policies that ensure children of all age groups fully
benefit from this technology. This includes strengthening support for children with special needs
and reducing the technical barriers they face. We could ensure affordability by paying attention to
the commercial sustainability and user affordability of ChatGPT in the education sector. We
should also encourage companies to offer reasonably priced products and services and establish

16

W. LUO ET AL.

funding programs to make the technology accessible to all families. We should strengthen
accountability by establishing clear responsibility and obligation regulations, ensuring educators
play a crucial role in using ChatGPT, such as acting as content filters and assessment reformers. In
addition, we could encourage schools and educational institutions to establish enhanced assess­
ment systems, ensuring students truly master knowledge and skills when using ChatGPT. In this
way, we can maintain sustainability by focusing on the impact of ChatGPT on learning motivation
and problem-solving ability and developing corresponding guidelines to ensure educators still
prioritize students’ active learning and critical thinking skills while using AI-assisted teaching.
Socially, we should promote social equity by considering the impact of ChatGPT applications in
education on social equity and developing policies to reduce the digital divide, ensuring all
students enjoy the benefits of AI technology. Meanwhile, we should pay attention to related
ethical issues and establish clear ethical and legal frameworks to guide and regulate the rational
application of ChatGPT in education.

Conclusion: Aladdin’s Genie or Pandora’s Box?
Whether ChatGPT is a “magic lamp” or a “Pandora’s box” for ECE depends on its implementation and
the extent to which educators, caregivers, and other stakeholders consider the potential benefits,
challenges, and risks. If used responsibly, ChatGPT could serve as a valuable tool to support learning
and teaching processes. However, if not properly managed, it would pose ethical, social, and technical
challenges. Therefore, striking a balance between leveraging its benefits and addressing potential
concerns is crucial for maximizing the positive impact of ChatGPT on ECE. To optimists, it might
be “Aladdin’s Genie;” to pessimists, it could be “Pandora’s Box.” Angel or Demon? Depends on how
you view and handle it.
