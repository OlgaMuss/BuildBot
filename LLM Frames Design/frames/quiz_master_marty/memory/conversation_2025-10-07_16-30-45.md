## Conversation Flow

### Turn 0 - System
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07T16:30:45  
Quiz session started with students: Red, Green, Blue

### Turn 1 - Marty (Quiz Master)
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07T16:30:45  
**Target**: Red  
Hey everyone! So excited to dive into microcontrollers with you all! Alright Red, you're up first - no pressure though, we're all learning together! So tell me, in your own words, what do you think a microcontroller actually is? Like, how would you explain it to someone who's never heard of it before?

### Turn 2 - Red
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07T16:32:15  
**Performance**: Partially Correct  
Hey, I understand microcontrollers as a brain of a smart object. it alloys it to function autonomously

### Turn 3 - Marty (Quiz Master)
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07T16:32:15  
**Target**: Red (clarification), then Green  
Ooh, I like that 'brain' comparison, Red! That's actually spot on for one of the main parts. So you're saying a microcontroller is like the brain that makes devices work on their own, right? Can you think of a specific device where you'd find this 'brain'? Like, what's something around your house or school that might have one? And after that, Green, I'm curious what you think too!
