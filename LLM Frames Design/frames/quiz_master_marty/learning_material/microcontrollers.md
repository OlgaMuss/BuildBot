# Question Bank for Microcontroller Learning
## Focused for 15-Minute Oral Discussion Session (5 minutes per person)

### Individual Discussion Prompts (5 minutes per student)

#### Student 1 Discussion (5 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
"So, tell me what you know about microcontrollers. What comes to mind when you hear that word?"

**Follow-up (1 minute):**
"Can you think of any devices around your house that might have a microcontroller in them?"

**Deepening (2 minutes):**
"Let's say you mentioned a washing machine. How do you think the microcontroller helps it work? What does it control?"

**Clarification (1 minute):**
"If you had to explain what's inside a microcontroller to a friend, what would you say?"

#### Student 2 Discussion (5 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
"How would you explain the difference between a microcontroller and the computer you use at school?"

**Follow-up (1 minute):**
"What do you think the 'brain' of a microcontroller does?"

**Deepening (2 minutes):**
"Can you walk me through what happens when you press a button on a device with a microcontroller? What's the process?"

**Clarification (1 minute):**
"Why do you think microcontrollers need memory? What would they store there?"

#### Student 3 Discussion (5 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
"What do you think input and output pins are for on a microcontroller?"

**Follow-up (1 minute):**
"Why do you think microcontrollers work in loops? What does that mean?"

**Deepening (2 minutes):**
"Let's talk about a car. How do you think microcontrollers help control the engine? What decisions might they make?"

**Clarification (1 minute):**
"If you were designing a smart device, what would you want the microcontroller to control?"

### Follow-up Questions for Deeper Discussion

#### When Students Give Basic Answers
- "That's interesting! Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What makes you think that?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "How do you think that works?"

#### When Students Give Good Examples
- "That's a great example! How do you think the microcontroller knows what to do?"
- "What would happen if the microcontroller wasn't there?"
- "Can you think of another device that works similarly?"

#### When Students Seem Confused
- "Let me rephrase that - what I'm asking is..."
- "Think about it this way - imagine you're the microcontroller..."
- "What part of that is unclear to you?"

### Conversational Assessment Guide

#### Student 1 Assessment Points
1. **Definition Understanding** (1 point)
   - Can explain microcontroller as "small computer" or "controls devices"
   - Accepts: "tiny computer," "chip that controls things"

2. **Component Knowledge** (1 point)
   - Mentions CPU, memory, or input/output
   - Accepts: "brain," "storage," "connections"

3. **Application Examples** (2 points)
   - Names household devices (washing machine, microwave, car)
   - Explains WHY it needs control (timing, automation, decisions)

4. **Process Understanding** (1 point)
   - Describes input-process-output cycle
   - Accepts: "reads input, decides, controls output"

#### Student 2 Assessment Points
1. **Comparison Skills** (1 point)
   - Distinguishes specialized vs. general-purpose
   - Accepts: "smaller," "specific job," "embedded"

2. **CPU Function** (1 point)

### Discussion Facilitation Tips

#### Creating Comfortable Environment
- "There are no wrong answers - I just want to hear your thoughts"
- "If you're not sure, that's okay - just tell me what you think"
- "Feel free to ask me questions too"

#### Encouraging Participation
- "That's a great point! Can you tell me more?"
- "I hadn't thought of it that way - explain that to me"
- "What made you think of that example?"

#### Managing Time
- "We have about 2 minutes left - what else would you like to tell me?"
- "Let me ask you one more quick question..."
- "That's perfect - you've covered the main points"

This focused question bank supports the 15-minute oral discussion session with 5 minutes allocated per student, ensuring natural conversation flow while assessing understanding.
