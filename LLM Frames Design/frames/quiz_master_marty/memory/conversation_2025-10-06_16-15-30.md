- ‚úÖ Next target: Green (after Red responds)
- ‚úÖ Peer discussion approach
- ‚úÖ All checks passed

**Slot Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Speaker: Red, Performance: correct, Turn count: 1‚Üí2
- ‚úÖ Next target: Green (least turns)
- ‚úÖ Validate correct answer, increase difficulty
- ‚úÖ All checks passed

---

### Turn 9: Follow-up to Green
**Marty**: "Excellent, Red! The clock is absolutely right - that's a crucial component that keeps everything synchronized inside the microcontroller. Great thinking! Now Green, we've covered chip, power, inputs, outputs, and clock. What do you think is the most important component inside the microcontroller? What's the part that actually does the thinking and processing?"

**Slot Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Speaker: Green, Performance: pending
- ‚úÖ Next target: Blue (after Green responds)
- ‚úÖ Challenging follow-up question
- ‚úÖ All checks passed

---

### Turn 10: Green's Processor Answer

### Turn 11: Follow-up to Blue
**Marty**: "Perfect, Green! The processor is absolutely the brain of the microcontroller - it's what does all the thinking and processing! You've got it! Now Blue, we've talked about the processor doing the thinking, but where do you think the processor stores the instructions it needs to follow? What component helps it remember what to do?"
