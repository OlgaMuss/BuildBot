Students experience all three types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) through hands-on prediction challenges across three engaging topics: music recommendations, medical diagnosis, and joke recommendations.

**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Students:** 16 (3 groups of 5-6 students each)  
**Learning Goals:** Understand supervised vs unsupervised vs reinforcement learning, training vs testing concepts

## **Discussion Questions (Final 2 minutes)**

1. Which learning method felt most natural to you? Why?
2. Which method worked best for your final station topic?
3. When might each learning type be most useful in real AI applications?
4. What challenges did you face when you didn't have labeled examples?
5. How is this similar to how you learn new skills in real life?
