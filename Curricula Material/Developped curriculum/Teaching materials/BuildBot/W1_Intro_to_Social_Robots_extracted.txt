### Slide 6: Using Marty Robot from Robotical
- Introduction to Marty robot platform

### Slide 7: Types of Robots
**Different types of robots:**
- Industrial robots
- Service robots
- Entertainment robots
- Exploration robots
- Social robots (and many others...)

**Discussion question:** What type is Marty? Why?

### Slide 8: Social Robot Definition
**Definition:** Social robots are physically embodied agents with some autonomy, able to engage in social interaction, communication, cooperation, and decision-making with humans. These capabilities are interpreted as 'social' by people, according to cultural norms and conventions. (Henschel et al., 2021)

**Applications:**
- Healthcare
- Education
- Customer service
- Entertainment
- Assistance
- (these are examples, there are many more)

**Key principle:** Generally, the goal is not to replace humans, nor to become friends with humans, but to assist.

**Discussion question:** What is needed for Marty to be a social robot?

### Slide 9: Project Overview
**We are going to build a social robot, design how it will interact and then test it**

**Steps:**
1. Step 1: Assemble Marty
2. Step 2: Make it move
3. Step 3: Make it autonomous
4. Step 4: Make it hear and speak
5. Step 5: Make it safe to interact with
6. Step 6: Design a use case - testing learning

**Discussion question:** Can Marty help with learning?

### Slide 10: Timeline
- We will be working on this for 6 weeks

### Slide 11: Let's Start Building
- Screenshot of building guide
- Marty robot image
