#### Content Overview

##### Artificial Intelligence Definition
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a large domain in software engineering and is "defined as machine intelligence or intelligence demonstrated by machines"

Both classical programming and machine learning are subcategories of AI.

##### Machine Learning
Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to new data, and thus perform tasks without the use of explicit rules.

**Ways of Learning:**
- Classic, Non-neural algorithms
- Neural networks

**Outcomes of Learning:**
- Classification/Prediction
- Generation (GenAI) - creates content
- AI agents - decides and acts

**Types of Learning:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses classified/labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unclassified/unlabeled data  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns from experience through trial and error

##### Supervised Learning Examples
- **Face recognition:** When your phone automatically suggests tagging friends in photos
- **Music recommendation:** When Spotify suggests songs you might like
- **Content filtering:** Apps like WhatsApp learning to identify spam messages

##### Unsupervised Learning Examples
- **Content recommendation:** TikTok grouping users with similar viewing patterns
- **Shopping recommendation:** Amazon's "Customers who bought this also bought"
- **Automatic photo albums:** Google Photos creating albums like "Trip to Berlin"

##### Reinforcement Learning Examples
- **Video Game AI:** Minecraft's AI companions learning through trial and error
- **Recommendation timing:** YouTube learning when to show notifications
- **Learning apps:** Duolingo adjusting lesson difficulty based on performance

##### Large Language Models (LLMs)
A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation. They are also called Foundational Models and are costly to develop.

**Major LLMs:**
- OpenAI models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o1, o3, o4-mini series
- Google models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemma series
- Anthropic models: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 series, Claude 3 Opus
- Meta models: Llama 3.1, Llama 4 series (Maverick, Scout)
- DeepSeek models: DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V3

**Teaching Note:** The goal is NOT for students to memorize these models, but to realize that there are many different LLMs from various companies. Emphasize variety and choice rather than specific names.

##### LLM Infrastructure Requirements
- Data centers (Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle)
- AI chips (Apple, Broadcom, Google, Marvell, Qualcomm)
- GPU manufacturing (NVIDIA, AMD)
- Memory (Micron Technologies, Samsung)
- Continuous power, backup power, cooling systems, security systems

**Teaching Note:** The goal is to convey that LLMs are complex and require significant infrastructure (computing power, energy, cooling). Students don't need to know specific parts, just that it requires substantial resources and is costly to develop.

##### LLM Applications
- Brainstorming and co-creation
- Searching, summarizing and detecting patterns
- Tutoring, coaching and personalization of learning
- Evaluations, screening and gradings
- AI Agents

#### Assessment
- **The Machine Learning Types Worksheet:** Interactive game to understand machine learning concepts
- **Classification vs Generation Worksheet:** Using classification vs generation worksheet
- **Feedback online Survey** link to add
