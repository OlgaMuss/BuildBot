# Stem and AI Literacy with Social Robots Curriculum - Teacher's Guide

**Note:** This guide is designed for the **Experimental Group (Building Group)** only. A separate teacher's guide will be provided for the Control Group, which will work with Marty 3 months later without the building component.

**Status:** Weeks 1-3 are ready for implementation. Weeks 4-6 are work in progress and will be completed soon.
