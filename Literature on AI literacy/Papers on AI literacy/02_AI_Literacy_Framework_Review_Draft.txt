REVIEW DRAFT (May 2025) 1

Welcome!
Empowering Learners for the Age of AI: An AI Literacy Framework
for Primary and Secondary Education (AILit Framework) is a joint
initiative of the European Commission and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Code.org and leading
international experts support its development. The AILit Framework
contributes to the PISA 2029 Media & Artificial Intelligence Literacy
assessment.
This draft framework also aligns with the broader European Commission
efforts to promote quality education and skills provision for the digital
transformation in the context of the Digital Education Action Plan
2021-2027. In particular, the framework responds to the 2023 Council
Recommendations on digital education and skills. It complements the
2022 Ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data
in teaching and learning for educators and DigComp 2.2: The Digital
Competence Framework for Citizens. More broadly, the EU AI Act, the
first comprehensive legislation on AI in the world, promotes a humancentered and risk-based approach to the adoption of AI systems. In
particular, Article 4 of the Act requires both providers and deployers of
AI systems to ensure that their staff, and anyone using the systems on
their behalf, have an adequate level of AI literacy.
This draft is intended to elicit feedback from educators and
stakeholders. We hope it sparks a dialogue about what AI literacy means
and how teaching and learning must evolve in an age of AI. We also look
forward to engaging with stakeholders over the next several months and
invite you to provide feedback at in-person and virtual events hosted
by the European Commission, OECD, Code.org, and our network of
international experts and organizations. Your input plays a crucial role in
shaping the future of AI literacy.

Introduction
Why AI Literacy?
As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly influences how we access information, communicate, and make
decisions, AI literacy becomes essential for navigating daily life, creating with purpose, and preparing for
the future of learning and work. AI literacy equips learners and educators to understand both the risks and
opportunities that AI presents, and to make meaningful and ethical decisions about its use. It helps learners
critically evaluate AI’s impact on their lives, education, and communities while preparing them to shape the
future. However, to fully realize the potential of AI literacy to shape learning, key barriers to implementation
must be addressed, including:
•
•

A lack of a shared understanding of what AI literacy is and how to teach it.
Uncertainty about how AI fits into various subject areas.

This publication serves as a starting point for teachers, education leaders, education policymakers, and
learning designers to understand AI literacy and decide how it fits their needs. Establishing a common
language about AI literacy is instrumental for consistency across diverse educational settings.

Definition of AI Literacy
AI literacy represents the technical knowledge, durable skills, and futureready attitudes required to thrive in a world influenced by AI. It enables
learners to engage, create with, manage, and design AI, while critically
evaluating its benefits, risks, and ethical implications.
This draft definition builds on existing definitions from the EU AI Act, OECD, UNESCO, and other organizations.

What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a “machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the
input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that
can influence physical or virtual environments” (OECD, 2024). As defined in the EU AI Act, and in alignment
with the OECD definition, “AI system means a machine-based system that is designed to operate with
varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or
implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content,
recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments” (EU AI Act, 2024).
The term “AI” in this publication refers to a broad range of AI systems. When warranted, specific terms such as
“generative AI” or “machine learning” are used.

Young People are Experimenting with AI and Need Guidance
As young people begin using AI in more aspects of their lives,
they need guidance to understand what it means, how it works,
and how to use it responsibly. The majority of young people
are already using AI, experimenting and practicing with AI in
both structured and unstructured ways in their personal and
professional lives (Merriman & Sanz Sáiz, 2024). But as they
use AI, learners may encounter disinformation, misinformation,
and bias, raising concerns over privacy and fairness. AI may
also create skills and achievement gaps among peers and
highlight a disconnect between what learners see as essential
to their future and what schools currently provide (Vodafone
Foundation, 2024).

AI literacy provides a clear understanding of how AI
technologies work and what their responsible use entails, so
that learners can make safe and informed decisions. Learners
can also benefit from the opportunities AI brings to their lives,
work, and studies. AI literacy must be grounded in trusted
information, a focus on ethics, and a commitment to social good.

(7,000 students across Germany, Greece, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Türkiye, and the UK)

AI Literacy is an Educational Priority
This framework centers on the role of AI literacy in teaching and learning, as AI’s emerging presence in
education affects how learners research, write, and collaborate, as well as how educators plan lessons and
provide feedback. A foundational understanding of AI supports educators in making their own decisions about
when and how to use AI based on the students and content they know best. Without this support, learners
may uncritically accept AI-generated content, adopt habits that compromise academic integrity, or neglect
skills like critical thinking and empathetic judgment. They may also overlook the opportunities AI offers to
enhance their own learning experiences and introduce new skills. Making AI literacy an educational priority
ensures that students know how to evaluate, question, and apply AI responsibly in their academic lives, and
thrive in contexts beyond the classroom.
Integrating AI literacy is a shared responsibility across the education ecosystem, rather than the duty of
any individual educator. Educators are encouraged to embed AI literacy when and where it aligns with their
subject and context. The competences outlined in this framework are intended to be developed across
a learner’s primary and secondary education experience, in formal and informal learning environments,
including schools, homes, and community settings.

Foundations of the AILit Framework
Building on Existing Frameworks
The AILit Framework builds on ideas and practices from previous digital competence and AI literacy
frameworks. Collectively, these frameworks ensured that the AILit Framework is internationally informed,
relevant to educators, and grounded in the ethical, technical, and social dimensions of AI literacy.

The European Commission’s Digital Competence Framework for Citizens
(DigComp) competence categorization and emphasis on learner agency in its
knowledge, skills, and attitudes influenced the content of the AILit Framework,
while its realistic employment and learning use cases informed the framework’s
structure.
UNESCO’s AI Competencies for Students and AI Competencies for Teachers
influenced AILit Framework’s focus on global relevance and implementation.
UNESCO’s work also prompted consideration for clear distinctions between
learner-specific AI literacy outcomes and ways that educators can support these
experiences in the classroom.
The Digital Promise AI Literacy Framework’s interconnected Modes of
Engagement, with cross-cutting AI Literacy Practices and enumerated Types of
Use, provided a foundation for how the AILit Framework defines competences
and frames learners’ specific interactions with emerging technologies.
The AI4K12 5 Big Ideas in AI informed the technical aspects of the framework,
including the nature of AI and role of data in the AI training process.

The AILit Framework builds on these efforts, emphasizing a durable foundation, interdisciplinary integration,
practical application, and insights from a global community of experts. It outlines essential knowledge, skills,
attitudes, and competences that will remain relevant as AI continues to evolve, with a focus on concepts that
transcend specific tools or trends. The framework also supports interdisciplinary connections across subjects
and empowers learners to engage with AI critically, ethically, and creatively.
The AILit Framework’s primary and secondary education scenarios illustrate how AI literacy can be
practically implemented in classrooms, and in some cases without the need for AI technologies. Developed
in collaboration with international experts in education and learning sciences, the framework is designed to
be foundational, adaptable, and globally applicable. Its implementation is supported by a diverse network of
partners in curriculum development, research, assessment, and policy. The final version of the framework will
be accompanied by classroom-ready exemplars and inform the development of the innovative domain of the
PISA 2029 assessment.

Research Process and Themes
This draft is informed by research that included the review of existing frameworks on digital competence,
media literacy, and AI literacy, and the analysis of curricula in computer science, data science, social sciences,
and career education. It also incorporates multiple research methods such as literature reviews, expert
interviews, and focus groups with potential users. Three key themes emerged from this process: technical
knowledge, the human skills needed to collaborate effectively with AI, and ethical considerations.

Theme 1: How AI and Machine Learning Work
Understanding AI helps learners dispel misconceptions about the technology and enables a more
informed evaluation of its implications. AI isn’t magic or all-knowing: It processes data using statistical
inferences and logic to produce outputs (Allen & Kendeou, 2023; Touretzky & Gardner-McCune, 2022).
It has been trained by data that comes from publicly available information, user-generated content,
databases, and real-time interactions collected through sensors and digital systems (AI4K12, 2022;
aiEDU, 2024). AI models “learn” not through authentic understanding, but by adjusting statistical
weights based on these datasets (Touretzky & Gardner-McCune, 2022). This produces sophisticated
outputs but makes AI vulnerable to replicating the harmful and statistical biases embedded in its training
data or introduced during development (AI4K12, 2022; aiEDU, 2024; Sparks et al., 2024). The AILit
Framework emphasizes that learners must develop a strong understanding of AI’s technical foundations,
including its reliance on data, probabilities, and inputs. By demystifying these technical underpinnings,
learners develop a comprehensive understanding of both AI’s capabilities and limitations. Ultimately,
they draw connections between how AI works and the ways it might impact themselves or others.

Theme 2: Human Skills to Emphasize for Successful
Collaboration with AI Tools
The AILit Framework emphasizes several skills and attitudes that support learners’
successful collaboration with AI. Traditional learning competences such as
metacognition and critical thinking remain highly relevant to interactions with AI.
Communication, questioning, and perspective-taking skills assume new importance
in interactions with AI and in broader discussions about its implementation (Thoman
& Jollis, 2008; Kafai et al., 2019; aiEDU, 2024). Traditional computational thinking
skills, such as abstraction, decomposition, and problem formulation, assume
additional relevance beyond the computer science classroom, as students encounter
technological challenges in their diverse everyday contexts (Allen & Kendeou, 2023;
Dasgupta & Hill, 2021). This framework deliberately centers human capabilities
within AI-specific competences, ensuring learners can effectively leverage AI tools
while maintaining qualities that technology cannot replicate.

Empowering Learners for the Age of AI - Review Draft (May 2025)

Theme 3: AI’s Effects on Individuals, Society, and the Environment
Learners must think critically about how AI already affects them and how it will continue to shape their
futures. Rather than treating ethics as a supplement to technical concepts, this framework emphasizes
that values, context, and accountability are inseparable from learning with and about AI. This approach
aligns with international research and existing policy recommendations and initiatives (European
Commission 2020, 2022; Miao et al., 2024; Vuorikari et al., 2022). Learners must understand that AI
exists within social and political systems and that algorithmic outputs can reinforce existing patterns
of unfairness if not critically examined. This also includes considerations about the ethics of how
training data was collected and classified (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Noble, 2018; TeachAI, 2024).
Throughout their interactions with AI, learners must reflect on its real-world implications: who can
benefit or be harmed by AI systems; what perspectives are represented and excluded in both training
data and AI-generated outputs; and, how AI systems influence personal autonomy, ownership, and
access to information (White & Scott, 2024; Miao et al., 2024). The AILit framework reinforces ethical
consideration through practical competences, mirroring calls to treat ethical evaluation as a core skill
in one’s digital life. Cultivating AI literacy helps learners navigate a world where technological decisions
are deeply intertwined with power, equity, and accountability. It equips them to ask not only what AI
can do, but also what it should do and whom it serves.
Additionally, the AILit Framework compels learners to weigh the environmental cost of using AI
systems with AI’s relevance to specific tasks. At the time of publication, AI systems require significant
amounts of energy, materials, and water, while contributing to global carbon emissions (Zewe, 2025;
Bashir et. al., 2024). Ongoing efforts to improve sustainability in computing focus on AI’s potential to
increase energy efficiency or address unique climate-related problems that other technologies cannot
(Bashir et. al., 2024). While AI’s long-term effects on natural resources have yet to be fully realized,
this represents an opportunity for learners to think more broadly about the relationship between the
digital and physical world.

The Role of Teachers and Educators

Teachers and educators play a key role in developing learners’ AI literacy by integrating AI concepts into
concrete classroom practice. They help learners connect abstract ideas to specific subject matter, guide
inquiry into how AI systems function, and create a supportive space for discussions about fairness, bias,
and real-world impacts (Allen & Kendeou, 2023; Chiu et. al., 2021). The primary and secondary education
scenarios that accompany each competence in the framework highlight ways that students can develop and
demonstrate AI literacy in educational settings. However, it is up to educators to decide when to introduce
AI tools, how to scaffold understanding, and what it means to assess student learning in a rapidly-changing
technological landscape (Allen & Kendeou, 2023; Chiu & Chai, 2020; European Commission, 2022; Miao &
Cukurova, 2024). Even more, they promote the responsible use of AI based on available guidelines from their
education system, and use their expertise to make age-appropriate decisions about its use (Miao & Cukurova,
2024). These decisions stem from an educator’s unique relationship with their students and their content
expertise.
Educators need targeted support to build their own AI competences and to develop effective pedagogies
for guiding students through this learning journey. The AILit Framework offers different ways for educators
to introduce AI literacy to their learning environments. Its knowledge statements emphasize a clear
understanding of AI’s technical foundations, equipping educators to approach AI literacy with confidence and
accuracy. The accompanying skills and attitudes, grounded in learning theory, metacognition, and recognition
of uniquely human capacities, ensure that AI literacy can be meaningfully integrated into existing classroom
practices. Learner-centered competences and education scenarios help teachers identify and prioritize
relevant AI literacy outcomes that can take place in their classrooms. To further support implementation, the
final version of the AILit Framework will also include a limited number of teaching and learning exemplars.
Ultimately, educators’ long-term success in teaching AI literacy depends on integrating new learning goals
with existing priorities and having access to high-quality initial teacher training and continuous professional
development that builds AI-informed pedagogy.

03
Framework Structure
The Four Domains of AI Literacy
The four domains of the AILit Framework represent different ways in which learners interact with AI.
Learners can build proficiency across multiple domains without developing full proficiency in any single one.
The four domains encompass 22 competences.

Engaging with AI involves using AI as a tool to access new content,
information, or recommendations. These situations require learners to first
recognize AI’s presence, then evaluate the accuracy and relevance of AI
outputs. Learners must develop a fundamental understanding of AI’s technical
foundations in order to critically analyze its capabilities and limitations.

Creating with AI consists of collaborating with an AI system in a
creative or problem-solving process. It involves guiding and refining AI output
through prompts and feedback, while ensuring the content remains fair
and appropriate. It also involves ethical considerations related to content
ownership, attribution, and the responsible use of existing materials.

Managing AI requires intentionally choosing how AI can support and
enhance human work. This includes assigning structured tasks to AI, such as
organizing information, so humans can focus on areas requiring creativity,
empathy, and judgment. AI systems can simulate a variety of roles, acting as
an analyst, debate partner, or career guide. Learners who manage AI’s actions
learn to delegate tasks thoughtfully, guide AI outputs with clear instructions,
and assess whether AI’s role aligns with their goals and values. This domain
helps learners build agency, ensuring that AI works for them and that its use
remains ethical and human-centered.

Designing AI empowers learners to understand how AI works and
connect it to its social and ethical impacts by shaping how AI systems function.
Through hands-on exploration in an education context, students examine how
data, design choices, and model behavior influence the fairness, usefulness,
and impact of AI systems. The goal is not to develop commercial products or
put them into service, but to build the confidence and capacity to shape AI for
human good by understanding the principles underpinning the design of AI
from an early age.

Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes
While competences may evolve over time or in different contexts, the framework’s knowledge, skills, and
attitudes provide a durable foundation for AI literacy. They prepare learners to responsibly interact with
existing technologies and navigate new ones as they arise. Each competence includes primary and secondary
education learning scenarios that apply to various subject areas and educational contexts. These scenarios
provide practical starting points for educators to include AI literacy in their own classrooms, with and without
direct access to AI. Find the full text of the knowledge, skills, attitudes, competences, and learning scenarios
in Sections 4 and 5.

Knowledge

Skills

Attitudes

The knowledge statements in the framework focus
on conceptual knowledge, outlining the technical and
societal understandings that learners need to apply
and engage with AI systems. These concepts include
how AI processes data, how AI differs from human
thinking, and how bias can emerge in AI systems.

The skills demonstrate how fundamental
abilities, such as critical thinking, creativity, and
computational thinking, apply in an AI context. They
guide learners in using AI effectively and ethically,
ensuring that learners actively shape how AI fits into
their lives.
The attitudes reflect mindsets and dispositions that
prepare learners to engage with AI, not only with
technical skills, but also with an awareness of AI’s
impact on themselves and others. These include
a sense of curiosity and adaptability in using AI
systems, as well as a readiness to question outputs
and a commitment to using AI responsibly.

Ethics in the Framework
Ethical principles appear throughout the framework’s knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and are
reflected in multiple competences. For example, the competence “Evaluate whether AI outputs should
be accepted, revised, or rejected.” requires learners to recognize that AI’s ability to generate humanlike content introduces risks, such as misinformation, disinformation, or manipulation. Learners must
apply critical thinking to detect misleading outputs and adopt a responsible attitude to ensure AI is
used ethically.

“

The EU AI Act reminds us that AI literacy is key for educators as they empower students to navigate the benefits
and risks of AI. By prioritizing AI literacy, we are empowering this generation of students with critical thinking and
informed decision-making skills that will tap into AI’s potential and help them thrive in a rapidly changing world.

Relationship to Other Topics and Disciplines
The AILit Framework reflects relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes found across multiple topics and
disciplines. AI literacy draws from areas such as ethics, computer science, media and digital literacy, data
science, and design thinking—connecting technical understanding with critical evaluation, responsible use,
and creative problem-solving. These interdisciplinary links reinforce the idea that AI literacy is a foundation
for navigating and shaping the role of AI across contexts.

Knowledge
The knowledge statements in the framework include facts, concepts, ideas, and
processes reflecting disciplinary, interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural
knowledge. They outline the technical and societal understandings that learners need
to apply and engage with AI systems.

The Nature of AI
K1.1: AI systems use algorithms that combine step-by-step procedures with statistical inferences (e.g.,
weights and biases) to process data, detect patterns, and generate probable outputs.
K1.2: Machines “learn” by inferring how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, and
recommendations that influence physical or virtual environments, in response to information from the
input they receive. They do so with varying levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.
K1.3: Generative AI uses probabilities to generate human-like outputs across various modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, visuals) but lacks authentic understanding and intent.
K1.4: AI systems operate differently depending on their purpose, whether to create, predict,
recommend, or respond.
Explanation: AI systems—including, but not limited to, classifiers, recommenders, predictive models,
generative AI, and autonomous agents – operate by processing vast datasets to identify statistical
patterns. As a broad class of technology, AI simulates intelligent behavior. Whether generating
content, sorting information, making predictions, or executing sequences of actions, these systems
aim to produce outputs that are statistically most likely to meet a given objective. While these
systems can produce highly sophisticated and human-like outputs, they do so without comprehension,
awareness, or intent. Understanding this distinction dispels the misconception that AI is all-knowing or
consistently correct, and helps learners assess its reliability, limitations, and potential impact.

AI Reflects Human Choices and Perspectives
K2.1: Building and maintaining AI systems relies on humans to design algorithms, collect and label data,
and moderate harmful content. These systems reflect human choices, assumptions, and labor practices,
shaped by unequal global conditions.
K2.2: AI is trained on vast datasets sourced from publicly available information, user-generated
content, curated databases, and real-world data collected through sensors, interactions, and digital
systems.
K2.3: AI systems gather new data from interactions with users; decisions, processes, and outputs may
be directly influenced by inputs in real time.
K2.4: AI systems are trained to identify patterns among data elements that humans have selected,
categorized, and prioritized.
K2.5: Bias inherently exists in AI systems, which can also reflect societal biases embedded in its training
data or algorithm design. Humans can perpetuate or mitigate harmful biases in AI systems during the
design, development, or testing process.
Explanation: AI is not neutral; it is shaped by the decisions of those who build it. Humans select
training data, which may have been collected unethically or feature inaccurate and incomplete
representations of individuals and perspectives. They also impart judgment during the classification of
that training data, which informs the algorithms that produce AI systems’ outputs. While statistical and
societal biases may exist undetected in training data or be reinforced in other aspects of the training

process, AI’s prevalence in decision-making and everyday life can replicate those biases in ways that
harmfully affect different groups of people. This makes ethics, algorithmic fairness, representation,
explainability, and accountability essential to AI literacy.

AI Reshapes Work and Human Roles
K3.1: AI systems automate structured tasks, augment decision-making, and transform industries,
requiring humans to adapt, reskill, and upskill.
K3.2: AI integration requires individuals to determine which tasks are best suited for machines and
which require human intervention or expertise.
K3.3: While AI can support analysis and prediction, humans must be responsible for decisions that
reflect human judgment and ethical considerations.
Explanation: The impact of AI across industries emphasizes the importance of adaptability and lifelong
learning. While AI systems can increase efficiency for many types of tasks, these tools might not always
be the best choice; humans must hone their knowledge of AI’s capabilities and their domain expertise
to manage AI systems effectively. Success in an AI-integrated workforce entails developing fluency in a
range of technologies, staying current with new tools and techniques, and leveraging human judgment
in decision-making starting from early ages, in and outside of formal education. This combination
ensures that AI complements human skills and augments human capacities, rather than replaces them.

AI’s Capabilities and Limitations
K4.1: AI excels at pattern recognition and automation but lacks emotions, ethical reasoning, context,
and originality.
K4.2: AI requires vast amounts of computing power and data, which consumes energy, thus demanding
limited natural resources and increasing carbon emissions. AI’s long-term sustainability impact, both
positive and negative, largely depends on how it is implemented and utilized.
K4.3: The capability of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), to generate humanlike content can make it difficult to distinguish fact from fabrication, increasing the potential to
generate misinformation, deepfakes, or manipulative materials.
Explanation: AI lacks a true grasp of real-world context, human values and behaviors, and nuance—
even when systems modify their own outputs to respond to a user’s complex emotional states.​While AI
systems can analyze enormous amounts of data, they are prone to bias, confabulation, and misuse and
rely on vast but finite natural resources. A human must make judgments about specific contexts that
AI systems cannot, including whether the benefits of an AI tool is worth the environmental or societal
cost. AI literacy requires critical thinking about when, where, and how AI should be applied to ensure it
serves human needs equitably.

AI’s Role in Society
K5.1: AI plays an increasingly prevalent role in decision-making that impacts humans, from hiring
practices to healthcare to criminal justice.
K5.2: AI systems must be understood, audited, and regulated to ensure that their use leads to more
benefits than harm for individuals and society.
K5.3: Generative AI and Large Language Models create content based on existing materials in
training data, which includes copyright-protected work, thereby raising questions about authenticity,
Empowering Learners for the Age of AI - Review Draft (May 2025)

20

authorship, and ownership.
K5.4: Ethical AI design encompasses fairness, transparency, explainability, accountability, respect for
privacy, and legal compliance.
Explanation: AI systems do not exist in isolation; their use reflects, reinforces, and reshapes societal
values and decisions. Without careful oversight, AI-driven decision-making can amplify bias and
cause widespread harm. AI systems introduce implications for how learners should think about truth,
authorship, and ownership in digital spaces. Individual and system-level guidance and regulations can
help address areas where AI intersects with fundamental rights, such as surveillance and data privacy.
Familiarity with ethical AI design principles helps learners to critically assess how AI systems are built
and deployed. Without the understanding, learners risk accepting AI outputs at face value rather than
asking whom they benefit or harm. To ensure AI serves society responsibly, we must continuously
question and evaluate its effects and guide its use to mitigate its risks.

Skills
These skills represent fundamental human abilities applied to an AI context. They guide
learners in using AI ethically and ensure that learners actively shape how AI fits into
their lives.

Critical Thinking: Evaluate AI-generated content for accuracy, fairness, and bias
to make informed and ethical decisions.
How can I check the accuracy of AI-generated outputs and reduce the risk of harmful bias?
How do I know if AI is relevant or appropriate?
Practicing critical thinking in an AI context involves verifying whether the information provided by an
AI system is accurate, relevant, and fair. Because AI systems can generate convincing but incorrect or
biased content, learners must actively work to identify potential misinformation and weigh outputs
with other sources of information. These actions result in a greater awareness of AI’s impact on the
broader information system. This process uncovers hidden biases or gaps and ensures AI outputs
support ethical decision-making. By developing these skills, learners exercise media literacy, digital
literacy, and digital citizenship, while becoming more discerning users of AI.

Creativity: Collaborate with AI to create and refine original ideas while
considering issues of ownership, attribution, and responsible use.
How can I use AI responsibly to bring my creative visions to life?
Exercising creativity when using AI involves interacting with AI systems to brainstorm, generate, and
refine original ideas. As learners use AI systems to explore possibilities beyond what they had originally
envisioned, they must consider AI’s impacts on originality, ownership, attribution, and copyright. By
engaging creatively and responsibly with AI systems, learners stay accountable for the ideas they shape
and share.

Empowering Learners for the Age of AI - Review Draft (May 2025)

21

Computational Thinking: Decompose problems and provide instructions in ways
that allow AI systems to effectively contribute to solutions.
How do I frame my problem so that AI can help solve it?
Computational thinking skills help approach and frame problems in ways that leverage the capabilities
of AI and account for its limitations. This involves decomposing, or breaking down complex problems
into structured components, and communicating goals and constraints in a manner that AI systems can
effectively process (e.g., prompt engineering). By providing use cases, counterexamples, and expected
outcomes to AI systems, learners refine their own communication skills, engage with metacognitive
strategies, and make progress toward their goals.

Self and Social Awareness: Recognize how AI influences personal choices,
relationships, and communities, and reflect on its broader societal and
environmental impact.
How does AI impact me and others?
Self and social awareness are vital when interacting with AI. This skill begins with recognizing AI’s
presence in daily life and understanding how it influences decisions in both the digital and physical
worlds. This extends beyond mere identification and applies to thoughtful consideration of AI’s broader
effects on individuals, communities, and the environment. Learners might also engage metacognitively
with AI’s effects on their own behaviors, thoughts, and learning processes. By recognizing AI’s influence,
learners are better equipped to evaluate AI-generated content and monitor how these technologies
influence their thoughts and behaviors over time.

Collaboration: Work effectively with AI and humans by communicating clearly,
giving feedback, and navigating shared tasks.
How can I collaborate transparently and ethically with AI to accomplish a goal?
Collaboration with AI relies on positive and productive interactions between humans and AI systems.
This requires the ability to both give feedback and ask for help in and outside of the digital world.
As learners collaborate with AI systems, they demonstrate agency alongside metacognition. By
collaborating tactfully, assessing strengths in context, and honing relationship-building skills, learners
develop the ability to navigate new and complex situations.

Communication: Explain how AI is used in a way that promotes transparency,
avoids anthropomorphism, and encourages responsible use.
How do I describe AI use for myself and others?
Communicating about AI involves explaining when and how AI systems are used, including how they
may have shaped content or contributed to decisions that impact others. This skill emphasizes that
AI-literate learners have a responsibility to accurately describe how AI works in ways that do not

22

mischaracterize or assign human traits to its capabilities. When learners choose their words to promote
transparency and responsible use of AI systems, they uphold ethical practices and encourage informed
conversation about AI’s implications.

Problem Solving: Determine when and how to use AI for a task by assessing its
capabilities, risks, and ethical implications.
How do I choose the right type of tool for the task at hand?
Using AI to address a problem begins with thoughtful reflection on the task at hand and includes
thorough consideration of whether AI’s capabilities meet the task’s technical and ethical requirements.
To do this, learners might test specific AI systems for reliability and potential to replicate harmful bias.
Learners problem-solve with AI when they ask themselves how AI systems might add value, where
human judgment should come into play, and when to avoid AI use altogether.

Attitudes
These attitudes reflect the mindsets and dispositions that prepare learners to engage
with AI, not only with technical skills, but also with an awareness of AI’s impact on
themselves, others, and society.

use of existing materials.

“

Where does creativity come from? We want to think it’s all in one person’s head. But even at professional design
schools, they put people in groups in these big, colorful rooms with sticky notes because having those things helps
you to be more creative. It helps you to get out more ideas. So, LLMs used well can be similar. If I have a thought
partner that I can improvise with, that could actually be a great creativity amplifier.

discussions, will be conducted to gather feedback on the draft framework. These sessions will engage
policymakers, teachers, educators, school leaders, NGO representatives, academics, and other relevant
stakeholders. Consultations will also take place at the European Commission’s Digital Education Stakeholder
Forum and through the European Digital Education Hub. Blogs, webinars, and announcements will be shared
by the European Commission, OECD, and Code.org throughout the process.
The final version of the framework will reflect international input and will be published in 2026, alongside a
limited set of AI literacy exemplars.
Over the next few months, we invite feedback from stakeholders worldwide.
To provide feedback, visit teachai.org/ailiteracy/review.

Use AI to Explore the AILit Framework!
Click for Prompt

A large language model (LLM) is an AI model specialized for tasks like natural language processing,
text generation, and translation. A prompt is a carefully crafted set of directions for an LLM-based
chatbot and can be used to help explore a document, ask critical questions, and reflect on the
content. Follow the directions to explore the AILit Framework using an LLM-based chatbot:
Navigate to the sample prompt via the button above or visit teachai.org/ailiteracy/prompt. On this
page, you will find the prompt text along with step-by-step instructions.
• Click the “Copy the Prompt” button to copy the prompt.
• Paste the prompt text into the chat interface.
• After pasting the prompt, upload the PDF of the AILit Framework into the chatbot.
• Finally, interact with the chatbot by asking it questions and following the guidance to explore
AILit Framework.
Within the inherent limitations of an LLM, this prompt and these directions are designed to create
accurate, document-based responses that include exact quotations with proper citations. Please
use the chatbot in accordance with all relevant guidelines.
