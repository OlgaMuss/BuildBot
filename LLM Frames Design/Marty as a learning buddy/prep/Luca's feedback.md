# Summary doc for week 5 - STEM literacy

## Microcontrollers
- What is a microcontroller and why do we use it?
- What parts has the microcontroller?

## Sensors
- What type of sensors are there?
- What do they do and when do we use sensors?

## Programming concepts
- Difference between loops, conditions, variables, functions, libraries

## Marty knowledge
- What type of microcontroller does Marty use?
- What kind of sensors does Marty use?
- What programming language can you use with Marty?

Either have each group select one topic for week 5 activity or have them all do the same topic

# Summary doc week 6 - AI literacy

## Week 5:
- Goal is to create a learning buddy, interactive, multi-user experience that helps you summarise and better understand the content we learned about STEM literacy (microcontrollers, sensors, and programming)
- Select
- Let’s try Marty out how it is, see if you can find an effective way for Marty to support you.
- First Trial -> out of the box as if they would use a chatbot
- Create a file with what did you do, what did not work
- Reflection: What went wrong, how did it go? Did Marty make mistakes? Brainstorm ideas: how could we improve that?

### Content:
- Repeat prompt engineering slide from week 3
- RAG as knowledge base or copy list of materials in instructions
- Second Trial -> use with provided background knowledge
- > update your document

### Content:
- What role is Marty taking? Do we need to tell him what he is doing and in what context he is in?
- Third Trial -> with background knowledge and defined persona

### Content:
- Structure the interaction and the output, step by step instructions.
- Fourth trial -> defined interaction
- Include the instructions that worked well and update instructions that did not work
- End reflection: how did the interaction change between trials

## Week 6:
### Start with intro:
- Conflict
- Going of topic
- Inappropriate content
- Pretends to be human
- Not transparent
- Data privacy (where does it store data)
- Environmental impact
- Mistakes and example safeguards

### Testing:
- Fill in your well working instructions from last week
- Come up with safeguards / instructions for Marty to keep the interaction safe according to what we’ve learned in this session. What do you think Marty should be aware off.
- Test if those instructions work one of by one.
- Create a document what did you do, worked well and what did not work well

### Reflection:
- Group discussion about what worked well and what did you notice?

### Interaction:
- Now we’re going to interact with a fully functional and safe learning buddy on a new topic. Marty is going to help you memorise and learn AI literacy / machine learning.
- First, select one or two concepts about Microcontrollers from the summary that you’d like to memorise, then provide that to Marty so that it has the same knowledge as you. -> Ask Nikos to implement knowledge window
- Third, update your instructions on how Marty should help you, if needed. Feel free to be creative and decide on a style or a context that Marty should use. Double check if your safeguards are appropriate for this interaction.
- Ask Marty to help you summarise the material you provided through one of the below options:
  - Come up with a poem
  - Come up with a visual scene
  - Come up with a story
  - Come up with an acronym
  - Come up with jokes
- Choose one of the options, and instruct Marty accordingly through voice interaction.
- Then work together with Marty to create your output and refine iteratively until you are happy with the result. You can also try multiple of the options above and see which one you like best.
- Attention: Try to spot if Marty makes mistakes (e.g., factual mistakes, doesn’t follow your instructions, doesn’t follow the safeguards)!
- At the end, select your favourite output, and present in front of the class.
