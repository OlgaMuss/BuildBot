### 7:35 - 7:55 (20 minutes) - Activity 1: Machine Learning Types Game
**Slide Storyline:** "Learning How Machines Learn"

#### Slide 3: Supervised Learning Examples
**Visual Elements:**
- Supervised learning examples with icons
- Real-world application scenarios
- Connection to daily technology use

**Teaching Points:**
- **Supervised learning (discriminative)** — uses classified/labeled data
- **Examples:**
  - **Face recognition:** When your phone automatically suggests tagging friends in photos, it uses supervised learning trained on photos you've previously labeled with people's names.
  - **Music recommendation:** When Spotify suggests songs you might like, it uses supervised learning trained on data like "User A liked songs X, Y, Z" to predict what new songs you'll enjoy.
  - **Content filtering:** Apps, such as WhatsApp, learn to identify spam messages by training on thousands of messages that were labeled as "spam" or "not spam" by users and moderators.

#### Slide 4: Unsupervised Learning Examples
**Visual Elements:**
- Unsupervised learning examples with icons
- Pattern discovery visualization
- Real-world application scenarios

**Teaching Points:**
- **Unsupervised learning (generative)** — uses unclassified / unlabeled data
- **Examples:**
  - **Content recommendation:** TikTok groups users with similar viewing patterns together without being told what the groups should be. It discovers that some users love cooking videos, others prefer dance content, and others watch gaming clips - all without anyone labeling these categories beforehand.
  - **Shopping recommendation:** Amazon's "Customers who bought this also bought" discovers hidden patterns in purchasing behavior. It might find that people who buy certain gaming keyboards also tend to buy specific mouse pads, without anyone teaching it these relationships.
  - **Automatic photo albums:** When Google Photos, or Apple Photos create albums like "Trip to Berlin" or "School friends," they are finding patterns in when and where photos were taken, and who appears in them, without being told these are meaningful groups.

#### Slide 5: Reinforcement Learning Examples
**Visual Elements:**
- Reinforcement learning examples with icons
- Trial and error visualization
- Real-world application scenarios

**Teaching Points:**
- **Reinforcement learning** — No data required, learns from the experience, etc.
- **Examples:**
  - **Video Game AI players:** Minecraft's AI companions use trial and error AI models getting rewards for successfully mining resources or building structures, and penalties for falling into lava.
  - **Recommendation timing:** Video recommendation timing algorithms such as on YouTube, learn when to show notifications by testing different times and seeing when it is most likely to be clicked on. If you engage more at 7 PM, it gets rewarded and learns to notify you then.
  - **Lesson difficulty adjustment:** Learning apps, such as Duolingo, learn to adjust how hard your German or English lessons should be by seeing if you succeed or struggle, constantly fine-tuning to keep you motivated but challenged.

#### Slide 6: Machine Learning Types Game
**Visual Elements:**
- Game setup instructions
- Cards activity visualization
- Hands-on learning elements

**Teaching Points:**
- **Let's play an unplugged game: Machine Learning Types Game**
- **Cards activity for hands-on learning**
- **Game Objective:** Students become "human machine learning algorithms"
- **Hands-on Experience:** Students experience how machines learn from data
- **Connection to Marty:** "This is how Marty will learn to recognize patterns"

**Activity Setup:**

- **AI Chatbots, such as chatGPT are Large Language Models, considered Generative AI**
- **Connection to Marty:** "LLMs will help Marty understand and respond to your questions"

#### Slide 8: Large Language Models Definition
**Visual Elements:**
- LLM architecture diagram
- Training process visualization
- Cost and complexity indicators

**Teaching Points:**
- **Definition:** "A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation. They are also called Foundational Models and are costly to develop."
- **In simple words:** A program that can converse with humans.
- **Source:** wikipedia
- **Training Cost:** Expensive to develop, requiring massive resources

**Discussion Question:** "Can you guess which type, way and outcomes LLMs (large language models) use?"

#### Slide 9: LLM Learning Process
**Visual Elements:**
- Three-step learning process diagram
- Learning types visualization
- Neural network representation

**Teaching Points:**
- **LLMs use all 3 types of learning in 3 steps:**
- **Types of learning:**
  - With labels: supervised learning
  - Without labels: unsupervised learning
  - By trial and error with rewards: reinforcement learning
- **Ways of learning:**
  - Deep neural networks
- **Outcomes of learning:**
  - Generation using prediction, and also used as an agent

#### Slide 10: Creating LLMs - Step 1: Unsupervised Learning
**Visual Elements:**
- Reading process visualization
- Pattern recognition examples
- Child metaphor illustration

**Teaching Points:**
- **Step 1: Unsupervised Learning - "Reading a lot"**
- **What happens:** The AI reads millions of books, websites, and articles without anyone telling it what's important. It just learns patterns in language - like which words usually come after others.
- **The metaphor:** Imagine a child who secretly listens to every conversation in their house, at school, and on TV for years. They start noticing patterns: "When people say 'Good morning,' others usually respond with 'Good morning' back" or "The word 'because' is usually followed by an explanation."
- **Real example:** The AI learns that after "The capital of Germany is..." the word "Berlin" usually comes next, just from seeing this pattern thousands of times in different texts.
- **Note:** Large language models use text data, but the same ideas are being applied to images, sensor data, audio data, etc. Those are not considered Large Language Models.

#### Slide 11: Creating LLMs - Step 2: Supervised Learning
**Visual Elements:**
- Tutoring metaphor visualization
- Good answer examples
- Human guidance process

**Teaching Points:**
- **Step 2: Supervised Learning - "Learning what is a 'good' answer"**
- **What happens:** Now humans give the AI specific examples of good answers to questions. They show it: "When someone asks this question, HERE is a good response."
- **The metaphor:** It's like the child now has a tutor who says: "When someone asks for help with homework, don't just copy what you heard people say - actually try to help them understand the math problem."
- **Real example:** Humans show the AI thousands of examples like:
  Question: "Explain photosynthesis" 
  Good Answer: "Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to make food..."

#### Slide 12: Creating LLMs - Step 3: Reinforcement Learning
**Visual Elements:**
- Feedback process visualization
- Good vs bad response examples
- Learning from feedback

**Teaching Points:**
- **Step 3: Reinforcement Learning - "Learning to provide a 'good' answer"**
- **What happens:** Humans rate the AI's responses as "good" or "bad." The AI learns to avoid responses that humans dislike and favor ones they prefer.
- **The metaphor:** Like getting feedback from friends - if they always groan when you tell certain jokes, you learn to stop telling those jokes. If they laugh at others, you tell more of those.
- **Real example:** If the AI gives a rude response, humans mark it as "bad." If it gives a helpful, polite response, they mark it as "good." The AI learns to be more like the "good" examples.

### 8:15 - 8:30 (15 minutes) - Activity 2: Soekia and Classification vs Generation Worksheet
**Slide Storyline:** "Hands-on Experience with AI"

#### Slide 13: LLM Summary
**Visual Elements:**
- Three-step summary diagram
- LLM development process
- Mathematical model representation

**Teaching Points:**
- **These 3 steps are involved in the building of Large Language Models**
- **Step 1: Unsupervised Learning - "Reading a lot"**
  Real example: The AI learns that after "The capital of Germany is..." the word "Berlin" usually comes next, just from seeing this pattern thousands of times in different texts.
- **Step 2: Supervised Learning - "Learning what is a 'good' answer"**
  Real example: Humans show the AI thousands of examples like: Question: "Explain photosynthesis" Answer: "Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to make food..." → Good
- **Step 3: Reinforcement Learning - "Learning to provide a 'good' answer"**
  Real example: If the AI gives a rude response, humans mark it as "bad." If it gives a helpful, polite response, they mark it as "good." The AI learns to be more like the "good" examples.

#### Slide 15: How AI Chatbots Work
**Visual Elements:**
- Chatbot interaction flow
- Memory file system
- Learning illusion explanation

**Teaching Points:**
- **AI chatbots use LLMs models**
- When we interact with an AI chatbot (send them text, called prompts), the underlying model does not change (the weights are unchanged), therefore technically does not learn.
- **However, software using LLMs can create memory files, which are added to prompts creating an illusion of learning.**
- **LLMs can apply their "knowledge" (patterns learned in the previous steps) to new data, like to analysing a new text and detecting its patterns, and by doing so, creating new knowledge for us to learn.**
- **Often our conversations are recorded and used as input or test data for new models (for ex. conversations with GPT-4 used to create GPT-5)**

#### Slide 16: Soekia GPT Activity
**Visual Elements:**
- Soekia GPT interface screenshot
- Activity instructions
- Interactive elements

**Teaching Points:**
- **Let's try a simple version of an LLM**
- **Activity Steps:**
  1. Go to the Soekia GPT website.
  2. Ask it to: "Write me a fairy tale".
  3. Pause the generation after a few words/sentences and click at the bottom on "select yourself". You can now click on the next word yourself (selected from the most likely matches of the model). Combine self-select/auto-generate to create a fairy tale.
  4. Click on "Look inside" in the top right corner to better understand how this works. Explore.
  5. Click on the trash can under the created story to start over again. Ask another question, e.g: Explain me the Pythagorean theorem. How well does Soekia do?
