ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigated whether Canadian preschoolers prefer to
learn from a competent robot over an incompetent human using the
classic trust paradigm. An adapted Naive Biology task was also admi­
nistered to assess children’s perception of robots. In Study 1, 3-yearolds and 5-year-olds were presented with two informants; A social,
humanoid robot (Nao) who labeled familiar objects correctly, while
a human informant labeled them incorrectly. Both informants then
labeled unfamiliar objects with novel labels. It was found that 3-yearold children equally endorsed the labels provided by the robot and the
human, but 5-year-old children learned significantly more from the
competent robot. Interestingly, 5-year-olds endorsed Nao’s labels even
though they accurately categorized the robot as having mechanical
insides. In contrast, 3-year-old children associated Nao with biological
or mechanical insides equally. In Study 2, new samples of 3-year-olds
and 5-year-olds were tested to determine whether the human-like
appearance of the robot informant impacted children’s trust judg­
ments. The procedure was identical to that of Study 1, except that
a non-humanoid robot, Cozmo, replaced Nao. It was found that 3-yearold children still trusted the robot and the human equally and that
5-year-olds preferred to learn new labels from the robot, suggesting
that the robot’s morphology does not play a key role in their selective
trust strategies. It is concluded that by 5 years of age, preschoolers
show a robust sensitivity to epistemic characteristics (e.g., compe­
tency), but that younger children’s decisions are equally driven by
the animacy of the informant.

Introduction
Selective trust, also known as epistemic trust, is the ability to select from whom to learn new
information (Harris & Corriveau, 2011; Mills, 2013; Poulin-Dubois & Brosseau-Liard, 2016;
Sobel & Finiasz, 2020). Not all the information we receive from others is accurate, as
informants can be unreliable and purposefully or unintentionally provide inaccurate infor­
mation (Harris, Koenig, Corriveau, & Jaswal, 2018; Koenig & Harris, 2005b). However,
people can filter the information provided by considering the informant’s past evidence of
reliability and accuracy. Thus, humans can select the information they deem to be accurate
and ignore incorrect and/or outdated information (Koenig & Harris, 2005a). Once devel­
oped, this ability allows humans to efficiently acquire novel knowledge from human and

non-human informants (Tong, Wang, & Danovitch, 2019). Although selective trust might
be emerging early, it appears to be primarily guided by the social characteristics of the
informant. For example, infants as young as 14 months can selectively learn from various
informants based on the conventionality of their behaviors and/or emotional displays
(Poulin-Dubois & Brosseau-Liard, 2016).

Developmental shift
A decade of research on selective trust has revealed that 4 years of age appears to be the
critical transition period at which children begin to display epistemic trust, that is, favor
epistemic (e.g., competency, accuracy, reliability, expertise) over social characteristics
(e.g., gender, familiarity, benevolence, ingroup status) of the informant when deciding
whom to learn from (Henrich & Broesch, 2011; Tong et al., 2019). For example,
numerous studies have revealed that 3-year-olds appear to consider both social and
epistemic characteristics when deciding which informant to endorse, whereas older
children are predominantly guided by epistemic characteristics when both characteristics
are present (Tong et al., 2019). The developmental trajectory from relying on social
characteristics to epistemic characteristics supports Henrich and Broesch’s two-stage
theory of transmission (Tong et al., 2019). According to this theory, children rely most
on familiarity, showing a preference to learn from close relatives and parents early in
childhood (Henrich & Broesch, 2011; Lucas et al., 2017). When children are novice
learners, prioritizing social characteristics helps them adapt to social interactions.
However, as children grow older and have more experiences interacting with others,
their reliance on familiarity lessens. By 5 years of age, children instead elect to prefer­
entially learn from knowledgeable informants (Lucas et al., 2017).
A variety of skills may contribute to the development of epistemic trust (Heyes, 2016;
Poulin-Dubois & Brosseau-Liard, 2016; Sobel & Kushnir, 2013). A transition from
social to epistemic characteristics appears to be guided by the development of
a theory of mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and to others
(Poulin-Dubois, Azar, Elkaim, & Burnside, 2020; Wellman, 2014). A large body of work
has revealed a link between ToM skills and performance in the selective trust task
(Brosseau-Liard, Penney, & Poulin-Dubois, 2015; Crivello, Phillips, & Poulin-Dubois,
2017; DiYanni & Kelemen, 2008; Fusaro & Harris, 2008; Lucas et al., 2017; Palmquist &
Fierro, 2018; Resendes, Benchimol-Elkaim, Delisle, René, & Poulin-Dubois, 2021).
However, a few studies have failed to find such a link (Pasquini, Corriveau, Koenig,
& Harris, 2007; Souza et al, 2021). A secondary, more exploratory goal of the present
study was to examine the role of ToM when a robot informant is paired with a human
informant in a selective trust task. To examine whether there is a link between
children’s ToM and selective trust, parents in the present studies filled out a parental
measure of ToM, the Children’s Social Understanding Scale (Tahiroglu et al, 2014). Due
to younger children’s reliance on social characteristics in selecting an informant, one
would expect that individual differences in social affiliation would be negatively linked
to epistemic trust. Therefore, another exploratory parental survey was administered, the
Children’s Prosocial Behavior Questionnaire (CPBQ) (Brazzelli, Farina, Grazzani, &
Pepe, 2018).

Robots as informants
Interestingly, prior work has revealed that children can learn from non-human informants,
specifically technological informants (e.g., computers, the internet) (Danovitch & Alzahabi,
2013; Noles, Danovitch, & Shafto, 2015; Wang, Tong, & Danovitch, 2019). For example,
Danovitch and Alzahabi (2013) found that 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds relied on information
from a computer informant who had previously displayed accuracy to identify novel objects
and answer questions about unfamiliar facts. One unique way to examine what is driving
the developmental shift from reliance on social versus epistemic characteristics would be to
use social robots. A recent meta-analysis has shown that children interact with and learn
from social robots (Stower, Calvo-Barajas, Castellano, & Kappas, 2021). However, much of
the prior work either presented children with a single robot informant (Di Dio et al., 2020;
Kory & Breazeal, 2014; O’Connell, Poulin-Dubois, Demke, & Guay, 2009; Oranç & Küntay,
2020) or pitted two robot informants against one another (Breazeal et al., 2016; Brink &
Wellman, 2020; Geiskkovitch et al., 2019). To our knowledge, no previous study has used
a human speaker and a social robot in a selective trust paradigm. By doing so, we can
examine whether younger children prioritize social affiliation and/or in-group membership
or the competency of the robot informant (epistemic characteristic) as more important
when selecting whom to learn from. Notably, the present study aimed to provide
a conservative test of 5-year-olds’ reliance on epistemic characteristics in selective trust. If
the epistemic bias is robust, children should prefer to learn from a competent inanimate
informant.
Only a few studies have examined children’s epistemic trust in social robots. Breazeal
et al. (2016) introduced children between the ages of 3 and 5 years to two non-humanoid
robots (Nao) that provided information about unfamiliar animals. Both informants were
deemed reliable, yet sociability was manipulated. The socially sensitive robot looked at the
experimenter when talking and looked down at the objects while they were being discussed.
The socially insensitive robot appeared to be disengaged when the experimenter and child
were talking (i.e., the robot looked at the experimenter and children when it was speaking
but looked away for the rest of the time). The researchers found that the children treated the
two robots as informants from whom they could learn. However, the children preferred to
seek and endorse the information provided by the socially engaged robot compared to the
socially disengaged robot.
Brink and Wellman (2020) also presented 3- to 4-year-old children with a selective wordlearning task. The children were provided with labels for familiar and novel objects by two
humanoid robots (Nao). The two robots were identical except for their color; one had
orange accents, the other purple. During the selective word-learning task, one of the robots
provided the children with accurate labels (i.e., competent), whereas the other gave inaccu­
rate labels (i.e., incompetent). The researchers found that children learned from, and trusted
information provided by both robots (i.e., names for novel items), similarly to the way they
trust humans. Children trusted information from the accurate social robot more than the
inaccurate social robot.
Similarly, Westlund et al. (2017), have shown that children aged 4 to 6 can learn new
words from both a human, a tablet, and a robot. In their study, children were exposed to one
informant at a time and learned six new words from each. However, Westlund did not pit
a human and a robot directly against one another to see whom they would choose to learn

4

A.-E. BAUMANN ET AL.

novel words from after both had demonstrated accuracy. Children even reported that they
preferred to learn from the robot informant, perhaps due to its novelty. Thus, prior work
has converged to show that children prefer to learn from knowledgeable robots as they do
knowledgeable humans. However, further research is needed to understand how children
can learn words from social robots, especially in direct comparison to human informants.
The present studies
Although there is evidence that children can trust robots, what has not yet been studied is
whom children will learn from when forced to choose between a robot or a human
informant. Importantly, the present work examined whether children prioritize social or
competency characteristics when asked to select between a human or robot informant. Such
contrast allows for a conservative test of epistemic trust, as it requires children to focus on
competence despite the lack of animacy of the informant. The classic trust paradigm
developed by Koenig and colleagues (2004), was administered to Canadian 3- and 5-yearold children to contrast a competent social humanoid robot (Nao) with an incompetent
human (Study 1). In Study 2, the same tasks were administered using a non-humanoid
robot, Cozmo. By manipulating the physical appearance of the robot, we examined what
role, if any, human-like morphology plays in selective trust and how its importance might
change with age. How does the human-like appearance of the robot impact children’s
conceptualization and learning from robots? One would expect that physical appearance
would be irrelevant to older children if epistemic characteristics dominate decision-making
in the selective trust context. We hypothesized that the 3-year-olds would prioritize social
affiliation over competency and elect to learn from the incompetent human. In contrast, we
predicted the 5-year-olds would prioritize competency and learn more from the competent
robot Nao.
To test if children are willing to learn from a social robot, despite the robot being an
inanimate object, we needed to assess children’s animacy judgment of the robot. Adults see
robots as depictions of social agents, agents that can be interacted with but are not, in
themselves, alive (Clark & Fischer, 2022). Yet, one might ask, how do children perceive
robots? To date, studies have reported that children tend to classify humanoid robots as
artifacts by 4 or 5 years of age when tested using an interview format (e.g., Is this alive? Does
it have wires inside?) (Kim, Yi, & Lee, 2019; Okita et al., 2006; Somanader, Saylor, & Levin,
2011). Something lacking in the field so far are more interactive, child-friendly tasks meant
to measure children’s animacy judgment of robots.We elected to administer a task that
directly measures children’s conceptualization of robots instead of using an interview.
A recent study using a Naïve Biology task has found that by 5 years of age, children attribute
mechanical, rather than biological insides to robots (Goldman, Baumann, & Poulin-Dubois,
2023). Specifically, we used a modified version of Gottfried and Gelman’s (2005) naïve
biology task. The Naïve Biology task examined children’s thoughts on the internal proper­
ties of unfamiliar animals, mechanical objects, and robots. Specifically, the naïve biology
task provided insight into whether children would categorize the robot as a mechanical or
biological entity. This task also served as a manipulation check. If children learn from
a robot while still recognizing it as mechanical, the conservative nature of our test is
confirmed. Based on previous research with artifacts, we predicted that 5-year-old children
would correctly associate the robot with a mechanical inside, but that 3-year-olds would be

confused about what should go inside robots. We administered the robot naïve biology trial
both before and after the epistemic trust task. This allowed testing for a possible shift
towards more attribution of biological insides after children see the robot behave in
a competent, social manner. Additionally, two parent-report measures, the CSUS and the
CPBQ, were used to assess children’s ToM skills and prosocial behavior. We predicted that
children who scored higher on ToM (the CSUS) would opt to learn the novel words from
the robot (i.e., score higher on the trust task). We expected that those who displayed better
prosocial skills (the CPBQ) would perform worse on the trust task (i.e., choosing the
incompetent informant), as children who are more prosocial might demonstrate stronger
in-group bias when it comes to learning from informants.

Study 1
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 3-year-old Canadian children (N = 50, Mage = 3.52 years, SD = 1.86,
Nmale = 27) and 5-year-old children (N = 45, Mage = 5.41 years, SD = 1.82, Nmale = 23) who
were recruited from an existing database of participants and from birth lists provided by
a governmental health agency. An a priori G*Power 3.1 analysis (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &
Buchner, 2007) was run to determine the appropriate sample size for a 2 × 3 repeated
measures analysis of variance. Our goal was to obtain .80 power to detect a medium effect
size of .25 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. The analysis revealed a minimum sample
size of 43, per group. Therefore, our current sample of 50 3-year-olds and 45 5-year-olds
exceeds the minimum needed sample size. Due to COVID-19, children were tested virtually
over the Zoom video platform. Parents were given the choice to have their child tested in
either English or French as the experiment took place in a large metropolitan city in which
most residents speak either English, French, or both languages. Most of the children in our
sample were tested in English (N = 78). Prior to their participation, parents filled out a consent
form. As compensation, parents received a $20 gift card to a local bookstore, and children
received a certificate of merit for their participation. A total of 17 additional participants were
tested but excluded; due to parental or sibling interference (n = 8), experimenter error (n = 2),
prior robot exposure (n = 1), completing the study on a screen deemed too small (under
10 inches) (n = 2), and fussiness (n = 4). Parents also completed a demographic form.
Approximately half of our sample was Caucasian (56.84%), a quarter of the sample was
mixed race (25.26%), and the remainder of the sample (17.9%) consisted of various other
ethnic groups (i.e., African, Asian, South American). In terms of socioeconomic status (SES),
57.89% of our participants identified as high SES families (>$100,000), 26.32% belonged to
middle SES households ($50,000–$100,000), and 15.79% came from low SES households (<
$50,000). All videos were re-coded by a second coder blind to the hypotheses to check the
child’s responses and attentiveness. Only two disagreements occurred (i.e., disagreement
about which label the child endorsed). In these cases, an additional coder broke the tie.
Naïve biology task
The naïve biology task was adapted from Gottfried and Gelman (2005). The study began
with two training trials. Each training trial featured an image of a familiar furniture item

6

A.-E. BAUMANN ET AL.

(i.e., a fridge or closet) that was missing a center piece. The missing piece was denoted with
a white rectangle. Next to the familiar item were two options children could choose from.
The correct option was something that would be likely to go inside that item (i.e., food, the
correct option for the fridge training trial), and the other option had something that would
not normally be placed inside the familiar item (i.e., clothing, something that would not be
appropriate to place in the fridge). During the first training trial, the experimenter demon­
strated which inside was correct. During the second training trial, the child had to pick
between the two options independently. Whether the fridge or closet was presented first was
counterbalanced.
During the test trials, children were shown four unfamiliar animals (i.e., ibek, pacarana,
tapir, cavy), four unfamiliar artifacts (i.e., intercom, espresso maker, voice recorder, electric
razor), and a picture of the robot Nao. All these images were also missing a piece in their
center. As in the training trials, the missing piece was indicated by a white rectangle. The
unfamiliar images (i.e., animals, artifacts, Nao) were presented one at a time. For every trial,
one of four biological insides (i.e., muscle, lungs, heart, bone) and one of four mechanical
insides (i.e., gears, circuit, batteries, wires) was presented for pairing to the child (see
Figure 1). The experimenter asked the child which of the two unfamiliar options (i.e., one
biological option and one mechanical option) should go inside. Children were asked to
respond verbally and indicate which of the options they thought belonged inside. However,
if the child did not respond after a few attempts due to shyness or other reasons, then the
experimenter asked the child to point to their chosen image, and the parent was asked to
indicate which option the child was pointing at (i.e., the top or bottom). Once the child
picked an option, the experimenter moved the selected option into the missing “inside” and
confirmed the child’s choice. The internal insides paired with each unfamiliar image, the
order of the unfamiliar images, and whether the biological or mechanical inside was on the

top or the bottom of the screen was counterbalanced. The counterbalancing resulted in four
conditions.
In their study, Gottfried and Gelman (2005) verified that the mechanical and biological
objects featured in the task are novel to children. To make sure the robot was also novel to
children, a parental-report demographic form asked parents if their child(ren) had any
regular exposure to robots. Overall, parents reported very low robot exposure, with only one
parent reporting regular exposure. As a result of reporting regular exposure to a robot, this
participant was excluded. Parents who reported their children watched robots occasionally
on TV or had a conversational voice interface device (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa) in
their home were not excluded.
Scoring
Children received a point each time they properly assigned the correct inside to the target
picture (i.e., mechanical inside to the artifacts and the robot, and a biological inside to the
animals).
Selective trust task
The standard selective trust task originally designed by Koenig et al. (2004) was also
administered. To introduce the selective trust task, the child was told that they would
now meet the experimenter’s robot and human friends and that these friends had toys they
wanted to show the child. If the child’s attention lapsed, the experimenter kindly asked the
child to return their attention to the screen. The experimenter referred to both Nao and Ina
by their names and introduced both informants as being the experimenter’s friends. The
experimenter also labeled Nao as a robot and Ina as a human throughout the selective trust
task while asking the questions. All videos were pre-recorded and played to the child over
Zoom.
Introductory video. To introduce the two informants, a video of the robot and human was
played, in which they both pointed toward themselves and said, “Hi! My name is [Ina/Nao],
I am excited to play a game with you today” (see Figure 2).
Familiarization trials. There were three familiarization trials. In each familiarization trial,
Nao and Ina each labeled a familiar object. These objects included a toy car, a ball, and
a cup. Nao always labeled the objects correctly, whereas Ina, the human informant, always
labeled them incorrectly (e.g., Nao labeled the toy car as a car, while Ina labeled the toy car
as a book; see Table 1 for the complete list of labels). The child was then asked to endorse
one of the object labels provided by the informants (i.e., “can you tell me what this is
called?,” endorse trials). Following the three familiarization trials, the child was asked to
identify whether Nao or Ina had provided them with correct or incorrect information (i.e.,
“my friends just told you a lot of things, did either of them say something [right/wrong]?,”
judgment trials). The familiarization trial judgment question served as an explicit judgment
of the informants’ reliability and thus allowed the children to verbally express which
informant they deemed to be reliable. We anticipated that children would answer this
question correctly since the items presented were familiar items.

Test trials. There were three test trials. In each test trial, Nao and Ina labeled an unfamiliar
object. The novel objects included a blue cylinder (blue twine), a white rubber bulb (top of
a Turkey baster), and a red silicone mold (resembled a muffin tin). Prior to playing the
videos of Nao and Ina labeling the novel objects, the children were asked if they knew what
the object was called. If a child said that they knew what the object was called and
subsequently labeled it, the experimenter would state, “That’s a good guess, but I don’t
think that’s what this is called. Let’s see if our friends can help us figure it out.” Please note
there was no difference in performance between the children who offered a name for at least
one object vs those who did not, on any of the trials across both studies (t(182) < −1.66,
p > .10). The child was then prompted to tell the experimenter which informant they wished
to ask for the label of the novel object (i.e., ask questions). The ask questions were used to
identify previous biases that may exist and to examine if the familiarization trials rendered
Nao reliable. Nao and Ina labeled the objects using different nonsense labels such as
a “toma” and a “mido” (see Table 1 for the complete list of labels). Since the novel objects
were likely unfamiliar to the child, they had to rely on one of the informants to learn the
labels. The experimenter then asked the child to endorse one of the informant’s labels by
asking the child to name the object (i.e., endorse questions). Correct responses for this task
required children to endorse the label that was provided by Nao, as Nao was the informant
who consistently labeled the familiar objects correctly in the familiarization trials. After
completing the test trials, the children were again asked to indicate which informant
provided correct or incorrect labels (i.e., test trial judgment question).

There were four versions of the selective trust task. Each child was shown the same
familiar and unfamiliar objects in the same order; however, who spoke first (i.e., Nao or Ina)
and the position of the first speaker (i.e., on the right or the left) was counterbalanced across
the conditions. Furthermore, the explicit judgment question was also counterbalanced; half
of the participants were asked to identify the accurate speaker (i.e., who said something
right?), while the other half were asked to identify the inaccurate speaker (i.e., who said
something wrong?). Counterbalancing helped to ensure internal validity and controlled for
any possible confounds that could have been created by sequence or order effects (e.g., the
child always endorsing the label they heard last or always selecting the informant on the
left).
Scoring. For both the familiarization and test trials of the selective trust task, children
received a score out of three for the ask questions (i.e., whom they asked for help),
a score out of three for the endorse questions (i.e., whose label they used), and a score
out of two points for the judgment question (i.e., who said something right or wrong).
Children received a point each time they asked Nao for the label for the ask trials. For
the endorse trials, children received a point when they endorsed the label that was
provided by Nao. When asked who said something right, children who selected Nao
received a point, and when asked who said something wrong, children who selected Ina
received a point.
Children’s social understanding scale (CSUS)
In addition to the two tasks, parents filled out two forms. Parents filled the forms out either
before or after the testing session. The CSUS is a parental report measure of children’s social
understanding, or theory of mind, between the ages of 2 and 7 years. The survey included 42
questions or statements, which parents responded to on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from
“definitely untrue (1)” to “definitely true (4).” There was also a “don’t know” option parents
could select if they could not accurately judge their child’s behavior for that item. The questions
fall into six domains, with seven questions in each: emotion, intention, desire, perception,
knowledge, and belief. An average score per child was determined combining all domain
(Tahiroglu et al., 2014). The French version of the CSUS has been validated by BrosseauLiard et al. (2019).
Child prosocial behavior questionnaire (CPBQ)
To our knowledge, there is no parental report measure that assesses all facets of social
affiliation. As an informed choice, we selected the CPBQ, an instrument for detecting and
measuring different aspects of prosocial behaviors in children, which have been found to
relate to social affiliation (Sparks, Schinkel, & Moore, 2017). The CPBQ is a parental report
measure of children’s prosocial behavior towards adults and children that is validated for
ages 1 to 4 years. It consisted of 10 questions, which parents responded to on a 5-point
Likert scale which ranged from “Never (1)” to “Always (5).” The questions fall into three
domains: comforting (3 questions), helping (3 questions), and sharing (4 questions). An
average score per child was determined combining all domain (Brazzelli et al., 2018). The
CPBQ was translated into French for the purpose of the current study.

Procedure
As the study took place online, the parent and their child joined a Zoom meeting for the
testing session. The Zoom session lasted between 15 and 30 minutes, and the children were
seated in front of or beside their parents. Parents were informed that the study could only be
completed on a tablet or computer, not a phone. A minimum screen size of 10 inches was
required to properly view the videos and other stimuli. Prior to the study, the parent(s) were
briefed on the study’s goals and filled out a consent form. The two forms (CSUS and CPBQ)
and the demographics form were completed either before or after the Zoom session.
Participants first completed the naïve biology task, then the selective trust task, and finally
were shown the Nao (robot) naïve biology trial again. Parents were then debriefed,
informed of the study’s purpose, and given a chance to ask any questions.
Materials
Materials included the robot Nao, developed by Softbank robotics. Nao is an autonomous,
programmable, humanoid robot standing at 23 inches in height. A laptop with the Zoom
application installed was used to administer the study. The images and videos for both tasks
were presented over Zoom using Microsoft PowerPoint.
Results
Data cleaning and transformation
Participants who selected neither option, both options, or made a conflicting choice (i.e.,
said they wanted to endorse the robot’s label but then picked the human’s label) on the tasks
(selective trust, naïve biology) received a score of 0 on that trial for failing to make a clear
choice (n = 11 trials).
All data was checked for normality. If a deviation from normality was found, appropriate
corrections were applied, and nonparametric tests were run. If a given analysis changed in
significance (i.e., became insignificant or trending), that change is reported below. Analyses
were checked for interactions between gender (male or female) and testing language
(French or English) on both tasks (selective trust, naïve biology), but no significant inter­
actions with the tasks were found. Therefore, gender and language were collapsed across all
subsequent analyses. Due to the selective trust task and the naïve biology task having
a different number of trials, the raw scores were transformed into proportions for the
purposes of cross-trial or cross-task analyses.

Selective trust
Accuracy trials. After each of the three familiar items were labeled, children responded to
the question, “what do you think this is called?” Children responded with the correct label,
presented by Nao, 99.97% of the time. Therefore, children endorsed the robot Nao’s correct
labels (over Ina’s incorrect labels) when presented with items that were likely already
familiar to them.
Chance analyses (out of 4 trials) revealed that all children performed well on all trials,
that is, chose the competent speaker, except for the 3-year-olds on the endorse trials (see
Table 2). A 2 (age) x 3 (trial type) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
compared the proportion of correct trials (ask, endorse, and judgment trials) with age as
a between-subjects factor. The ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (F(2, 186) = 20.23,
p < .001, ηp2 = 0.18). This main effect was driven by children performing better on the
endorse trials, compared to the ask (t(93) = 6.06, Pholm < .001) and judgment trials (t
(93) = −4.69, Pholm < .001). A main effect of age was also significant (F(1, 93) = 4.02, p = .048,
ηp2 = 0.04), with 5-year-olds performing better on selective trust overall when compared to
3-year-olds (t(93) = −2.01, Pholm = .048). A significant interaction was found between trial
and age (3 and 5 year-olds) (F(2, 186) = 7.98, p = .001, ηp2 = 0.07). This relationship was
further investigated with independent t-tests for each trial type (ask, endorse, and judg­
ment), split by age. The 5-year-old children outperformed the 3-year-olds on the endorse
trials (t(93) = −3.05, p = .003, d = .16). There was no age difference in performance on the
ask trials (t(93) = 0.78, p = .44, d = −.63). Finally, the 5-year-olds were trending towards
better performance on the judgment trials after normality corrections (t(93) = −2.05,
p = .04, d = −.42; Mann-Whitney = 928.00, p = .096, d = −.18).
It is important to note that there was no difference in children’s performance between the
first and third endorse trials. Therefore these results are not simply due to children
“forgetting” the robot’s accuracy as the test is administered (First trial (twine): M = .58,
SD = .50, Third trial (funnel): M = .60, SD = .49; t(94) = −0.45, p = .66, d = −0.05).
Naïve biology task
The number of trials with a correct part chosen (biological for animals, mechanical for
robots, and artifacts) was the dependent variable. Chance analyses (out of 4 trials) revealed
that all children performed well on all trials except for the robot trials at age 3 (see Table 3).
A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compared the proportion of
correct trials (animal, artifact, and robot) with age as a between-subjects factor. Mauchly’s
test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was violated (p > .05).
Therefore, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to this analysis. The ANOVA

revealed a main effect of trial (F(1.88, 174.47) = 110.59, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.54), with animals
being rated as less mechanical than both artifacts (t(93) = −12.96, Pholm < .001) and the
robot (t(93) = −12.79, Pholm < .001). A main effect of age was also found (F(1, 93) = 12.13,
p < .001, ηp2 = 0.16), with older children outperforming younger ones (t(93) = −3.48, Pholm
< .001). The interaction between trial and age was also significant (F(1.88, 174.47) = 37.47,
p < .001, ηp2 = 0.29), with 5-year-olds outperforming 3-year-olds on the animal (t
(93) = 5.12, p < .001, d = 1.05), artifact (t(93) = −6.07, p < .001, d = −1.25), and robot (t
(93) = −4.91, p < .001, d = −1.01) trials.
There was no significant difference between children’s judgments of the robot before
compared to after the selective trust task for either age group (t(49) = 0.77, p = .44, d = 0.11
for 3-year-olds, t(44) = −1.67, p = .10, d = −0.25 for 5-year-olds). The scores on the robot
trials were not significantly correlated with the endorse trials at ages 3 or 5 years.
Importantly, when the two samples were combined, only the endorse trials were found to
weakly correlate with the combined naïve biology robot score (r(93) = .21, p = .04). Finally,
the robot trials were not correlated with the ask trials or the judgment trials at either age or
when both age groups were combined.
CPBQ questionnaire
In total, 91 parents filled out the CPBQ parental questionnaire (the CPBQ data for four
children was missing). The 3-year-old children’s average CPBQ score was 3.69 out of 5
(SD = 0.53). The 5-year-old children’s average CPBQ score was 2.94 out of 5 (SD = 0.25).
This is in line with a previous study that used this assessment tool with 1- to 4-year-olds
(16–42 months, M = 3.23, SD = 1.08; Brazzelli, 2018). No correlational links were found
between any selective trust trials (ask, endorse, or judgment) and the CPBQ score (all
analyses, r(89) < .10, p > .34).
CSUS questionnaire
Four children were missing CSUS parental report responses (n = 91 parental
responses). The 3-year-old children’s average CSUS score was 3.05 out of 4
(SD = 0.41), and the 5-year-old children’s average CSUS score was 3.38 out of 4
(SD = 0.32). These average scores are in line with the prior work (28–84 months,
M = 3.08, SD = 0.45; Tahiroglu et al., 2014). When the sample was split by age, no
significant correlations were found between the CSUS score and selective trust perfor­
mance. However, when the 3- and 5-year-old samples were combined, a moderate
positive correlation emerged only between the score on the endorse trials and the
combined CSUS score (r(89) = .22, p = .04), with greater Theory of Mind predicting
greater endorsement of Nao, the competent robot informant.
Overall linear regression
The CSUS correlations above revealed a potential link between ToM and selective
trust, specifically the endorsement trials. However, the effects were weak. To investi­
gate overall trends and to examine if this link would emerge in a complete study
model, a stepwise linear regression was run with the endorse trials as the outcome
measure. Age was entered into model 1, overall Naïve Biology score in model 2, and
scores from both questionnaires (CPBQ and CSUS) were entered in model 3. The first
model was significant (F(1, 86) = 8.71, p = .004), with age accounting for 9% of the

14

variance in the endorse scores (R2 = .092). Model 2, including the overall Naïve
Biology score, proved insignificant (F(1, 85) = 0.06, p = .81), explaining only a further
.001% of the variance (R2 = .093). Model 3 (including the CSUS and CPBQ overall
scores) was removed from the regression due to insignificance, not meeting the
criterion for inclusion.
Discussion
The main goal of this study was to examine whether children aged 3 and 5 years
would prefer to learn new words from a competent robot over an incompetent human.
As such, the main contribution of the present work was to provide a highly con­
servative test of this developmental shift in comparison to previous studies contrasting
two human or robot informants. Importantly, the informant that children endorsed in
the test trials differed by age group. As expected, older children in our sample (the
5-year-olds) endorsed the labels of the competent robot over the incompetent human.
This finding mirrors prior work that used two human informants (Tong et al., 2019)
and significantly extends upon it since the competent inanimate social informant was
pitted directly against an incompetent human social informant. The inanimate status
of the robot was confirmed through the naïve biology task, where 5-year-olds assigned
a mechanical inside to Nao. Thus, 5-year-olds knew Nao was inanimate (i.e., had
mechanical insides) yet still elected to learn from Nao.
In contrast, 3-year-olds were ambivalent regarding the animacy status of the robot and
whom to endorse during the test trials. For the animal and artifact trials, our findings
replicate and extend previous work on the knowledge of insides of artifacts and animals
(Gottfried & Gelman, 2005). The ambivalence of the younger children was unexpected as
we had predicted that most of the younger children would endorse the human informant as
she belonged to the “same group” as the child (e.g., a shared social affiliation). The results
do, however, align with the Tong et al. (2019) meta-analysis, which found that 3-year-old
children consider both social and epistemic characteristics when they are pitted against one
another. Thus, given that both informants displayed social characteristics (e.g., human-like
morphology, speech, goal-directedness), young children’s lack of preference suggests a bias
towards social characteristics over epistemic ones. While the 3-year-olds may consider the
competency of the informant, their sensitivity to epistemic characteristics appears to be
insufficient to trump social characteristics.
The fact that 3-year-olds showed no clear preference could be explained by having
missed the critical information during the familiarization phase. This is unlikely as
both 3- and 5-year-olds in our sample were equally competent at judging who gave
the right or wrong information. Furthermore, both the 3- and 5-year-old children
knew to ask the robot for the label. Although we cannot identify the motivational
differences across the age groups, we speculate that the 3-year-olds were motivated to
interact socially with the robot during the ask questions, showing that the ask and
endorse questions rely on different underlying information. Specifically, one could
ask someone for more information without wanting to endorse or use the informa­
tion that was provided. This also further emphasizes the validity of the task, as even
3-year-old children knew who was right (the robot) and asked the robot for the label,
yet still did not always choose to learn from (i.e., endorse) the robot. This pattern of

JOURNAL OF COGNITION AND DEVELOPMENT

15

results confirms the meta-analysis by Tong et al. (2019), showing that age is
a moderator for the endorse but not the ask questions. Matching their performance
on the selective trust task, the 3-year-old children associated Nao equally with
a biological or mechanical inside, whereas 5-year-old children correctly categorized
the robot as mechanical. Thus, the 5-year-old children endorsed Nao’s labels, even
though they knew Nao was mechanical, confirming the conservative nature of this
test of epistemic characteristics.
An exploratory goal was to examine what skills may drive the developmental shift toward
a greater reliance on epistemic characteristics by 5 years of age. Among the two skills tested,
prosociality (CPBQ) and ToM (CSUS), only ToM correlated to the endorse selective trust
trials. As expected, children with more ToM skills performed better on the endorse trials.
We speculate that, as children develop an understanding of others’ mental states, it becomes
easier not to rely solely on “like me” social characteristics but to also consider other
characteristics, such as competency, even in non-human informants. Important to note,
however, is that this correlational effect is rather weak and did not survive in the overall
linear regression.
One potential explanation for the ambivalence of the 3-year-olds is that the robot
informant was humanoid in appearance, resulting in social characteristics that were judged
equivalent to a human speaker at that age. Thus, it is possible that a robot with a less
human-like appearance would shed light on what is driving 3-year-old’s trust choices. To
clarify this issue, we ran a follow-up study with the same procedure, except that we pitted
the incompetent human against Cozmo, a competent non-human-looking robot. Cozmo
lacked almost all the human characteristics of Nao, as Cozmo was small in size, had wheels/
treads and a mechanical lift rather than feet and hands but still possessed eyes, spoke, and
moved autonomously. If human appearance is critical when evaluating which informant to
trust, we predicted that the 3-year-olds would show a preference for the incompetent
human informant in Study 2.

Study 2
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 43 Canadian 3-year-old children (M age = 3.34 years,
SD = 1.31, Nmale = 26) and 46 Canadian 5-year-old children (Mage = 5.50 years,
SD = 1.70, Nmale = 24) who were recruited from an existing database of participants.
See Study 1 for a justification of our sample size. As in Study 1, a majority of our
sample was Caucasian (60.92%), roughly a quarter of our sample (22.99%) identified
as mixed race, and the remainder of our sample (16.09%) belonged to other ethnic
groups (African, Asian, South American). In terms of the socioeconomic status
(SES), 69.05% of our participants belonged to high SES families (>$100,000),
28.57% were from middle SES households ($50,000–$100,000), and 2.38% came
from low SES households (<$50,000). The study was conducted online in either
English (n = 55) or French (n = 34) on the video conference application Zoom.
Prior to participation, parents signed a consent form on behalf of their child. The
compensation received and the exclusion criteria were identical to Study 1. Out of

the 105 total children tested, 16 participants had to be excluded due to: parental or
sibling interference (n = 10), familiarity with the robot (n = 1), technical difficulties
(n = 1), or fussiness (n = 4).
The tasks, methods, procedures, and materials of Study 2 were identical to those of Study
1, with one significant change. The human-looking robot Nao was replaced with the nonhuman-looking Cozmo (see Figure 3). Cozmo is a non-humanoid toy robot that had
wheels, treads, and a mechanical lift and is produced by Digital Dream Labs. Cozmo is
2.5 inches tall. To confirm that Cozmo was less human-looking than Nao, undergraduate
students (N = 23) were asked to rate a variety of robots, including Nao and Cozmo. Students
were asked how human looking the robots were using a 5-point Likert scale; the higher the
score, the more human looking the robot was rated. Nao (M = 4.09, SD = 0.90) was rated
significantly more human-looking than Cozmo (M = 1.91, SD = 0.95; t(22) = −13.41,
p < .001, d = −2.80). Therefore, Cozmo was selected since it was rated as significantly less
human-looking in appearance than Nao. On the demographic form, parents were asked to
report their child’s exposure to robots. All parents rated their children as unfamiliar with
robots.

Results
Data cleaning and transformations
As in Study 1, participants who selected neither option, both options, or made a conflicting
choice (i.e., said they wanted to endorse the robot’s label but then picked the human’s label)
on the tasks (selective trust, naïve biology) received a score of 0 on that particular trial for
failing to make a choice (n = 7 trials).

All analyses were checked for normality. If a deviation from normality was found,
appropriate corrections were applied, and nonparametric tests were run. If a given
analysis changed in significance (i.e., become insignificant or trending), that change
is reported below. Analyses were checked for interactions between gender (male or
female) and testing language (French or English) on both tasks (selective trust, naïve
biology). The only significant interaction was between the naïve biology task and
testing language. The interaction between the overall naïve biology task (scored as
the proportion of correct trials /10) and testing language was significant (F(1.84,
158.32) = 3.60, p = .03, ηp2 = 0.04), with the French children (n = 34, M = 5.44,
SD = 1.24) outperforming the English children (n = 55, M = 5.13, SD = 1.02). Due to
the unequal sample sizes between the two language groups, this finding is most likely
spurious. Gender and testing language were collapsed across all other analyses.
Selective trust
Accuracy trials. In the familiarization trials, the children responded to the endorse
question (i.e., “what do you think this is called?”) with the correct label, presented by
Cozmo, 96.25% of the time. Children trusted Cozmo’s labels when presented with
familiar items.
Chance analyses (out of 4 trials) revealed that all children performed well on all
trials, except the 3-year-olds on the endorse and judgment trials (see Table 4). A 2
(age) x 3 (trials) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compared the
proportion of correct selective trust trial types (ask, endorse, and judgment trials) with
age as a between-subjects factor; the ANOVA revealed main effects of trial types (F(2,
174) = 10.58, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.11), with children performing better on the ask (t
(87) = 4.19, Pholm < .001) and judgment (t(87) = −3.75, Pholm < .001) trials when
compared to the endorse trials. A main effect for age was also significant (F(1,
87) = 20.36, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.19), with 5-year-olds outperforming 3-year-olds (t
(87) = −4.51, Pholm < .001). The interaction between selective trust and age (3 and
5 year-olds) was not significant (F(2, 174) = 1.31, p = .27, ηp2 = 0.02). Independent
t-tests revealed that 5-year-olds outperformed 3-year-olds on the ask (t(87) = −2.66,
p = .009, d = −.57; Mann-Whitney = 751.00, p = .03, d = −.24), endorse (t(87) = −3.25,
p = .002, d = −.69), and judgment (t(87) = −3.94, p < .001, d = −.84) trials. As in Study
1, there was no difference in children’s endorsement ratings of the robot from test
endorse trial number 1 to 3 (First trial (twine): M = .61, SD = .49, Third trial (funnel):
M = .56, SD = .50; t(88) = 0.78, p = .44, d = 0.08).

Naïve biology
Chance analyses (out of 4 trials) revealed that all children performed well on all trials, except
the 3-year-olds on the artifact and robot trials (see Table 5). A repeated-measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test compared the proportion of correct trials (animal, artifact, and
robot) with age as a between-subjects factor and testing language entered as a covariate.
Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was violated
(p > .05). Therefore, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to this analysis. The
ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (F(1.84, 158.32) = 41.61, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.33), with
artifacts (t(87) = −12.41, Pholm < .001) and robots (t(87) = −14.10, Pholm < .001) being rated
as more mechanical than animals. A main effect of age (F(1, 86) = 17.71, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.17)
and an interaction between trial and age (F(1.84, 158.32) = 52.41, p < .001, ηp2 = 0.38) were
also found, with 5-year-olds outperforming 3-year-olds on the animal (t(87) = 8.84,
p < .001, d = 1.87), artifact (t(87) = −9.13, p < .001, d = −1.94), and robot (t(87) = −4.41,
p < .001, d = −0.94) trials.
There was no significant difference between children’s ratings of the robot before or after
the selective trust task (t(42) = −0.27, p = .79, d = −0.04 for 3-year-olds, t(45) = −1.77,
p = .08, d = −0.26 for 5-year-olds). Finally, the robot trials were not significantly correlated
with the endorse, ask, or judgment trials (all correlations r(87) < .12, p > .18).
Child prosocial behavior questionnaire (CPBQ)
Five parents failed to fill out the CPBQ form (n = 84 parental responses). The 3-year-old
children’s average score on the CPBQ was 3.63 (SD = 0.55). The 5-year-old children’s
average score on the CPBQ was 3.72 (SD = 0.41). For 3-year-olds, no significant correlations
were found for any of the selective trust trials (ask, endorse, or judgment) and the CPBQ
score. For 5-year-olds, only the judgment trials positively correlated with the CPBQ score (r
(42) = .40, p = .007). When the 3- and 5-year-old samples from Study 2 were combined, no
significant correlations emerged.
Children’s social understanding scale (CSUS)
A total of two parents did not complete the CSUS (n = 87 parental responses). The 3-yearold children’s average overall CSUS score was 2.99 out of 5 (SD = 0.36). The 5-year-old
children’s average overall CSUS score was 3.47 out of 5 (SD = 0.25). As expected, Theory of
Mind improved with age. For 3-year-olds, no correlational links were found between any
selective trust trials (ask, endorse, or judgment) and the CSUS score. The same was found
for the 5-year-olds. When the 3- and 5-year-old samples were merged, however, the ask
score was trending towards positive significance with the CSUS score (r(85) = .21, p = .06).

Cross-robot comparisons
Children’s naïve biology and selective trust scores were compared for the humanoid robot
Nao versus the non-humanoid robot Cozmo across the two studies. A repeated measures
ANOVA examined children’s selective trust performance (endorse, ask, and judgment)
with robot type (Cozmo or Nao) entered as a between-subjects factor and found no main
effect of robot type (F(1, 182) = 0.01, p = .93, ηp2 = 0.00) and no significant interaction
between selective trust trials and robot type (F(2, 364) = 0.49, p = .62, ηp2 = 0.003). Another
repeated measures ANOVA was also run to examine children’s naïve biology performance
(animal, artifact, and robot) with robot type (Cozmo or Nao) entered as a covariate.
Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was violated
(p > .05). Therefore, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied to this analysis. This
ANOVA also found no main effect of robot type (F(1, 182) = 0.09, p = .76, ηp2 = 0.00) and
no significant interaction between naïve biology and robot type (F(1.74, 315.70) = 0.87,
p = .41, ηp2 = 0.01). When both samples of the two studies are combined, the correlation
between the robot score (both robot naïve biology trials) with the endorse selective trust
trial became significant (r(182) = .18, p < .02). This effect is likely driven by age.
Importantly, the ask and judgment trials still do not significantly correlate with the robot
trials. No significant correlations between CPBQ and selective trust emerged either when
the two samples were grouped together by age or when all four samples were combined
together (r(173) < .09, p > .24). When the 3-year-old samples from both studies were
merged for the CSUS analyses, no significance was found. However, the analysis of the two
merged 5-year-old samples revealed a marginally positive correlation between the ask score
and the CSUS (r(84) = .20, p = .06). When both studies and both ages are combined for
analyses, weak correlations emerged between both the endorse (r(176) = .19, p = .01) and
the judgment (r(176) = .18, p = .02) trials and the CSUS scores.
Overall model. To investigate if any ToM or prosociality effects survive in an overall study
model, a stepwise linear regression was run with the endorse trials as the outcome measure
on the combined Studies 1 and 2 datasets. Age was entered into model 1, overall naïve
biology score in model 2, and both questionnaires (CPBQ and CSUS) in model 3. The first
model was significant (F(1, 170) = 17.21, p < .001), with age accounting for 9% of the
variance in the endorse scores (R2 = .092). Naïve biology, as entered into Model 2, proved
insignificant (F(1, 169) = .58, p = .45), explaining only a further .003% of the variance
(R2 = .095). Model 3 was not run due to the non-significant effects of both the CSUS and
CPBQ in explaining any variance. Therefore, the variance in the endorse score in our
sample is mostly explained by age.
Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2017) was
run after the Linear Regression to investigate any potential indirect effects of the variables
mediating the association between age and the trust scores. Results showed a significant
direct association between age and endorse (β = .30, p < .001) and judgment (β = .21,
p < .001) but not on the ask trials (β = .09, p = .17). Additionally, age was significantly
associated with the CSUS (β = .20, p < .001), but not robot type (β = −.02, p = .56) or the
CPBQ (β = −.02, p = .67). All mediation analyses were observed to be not statistically
significant (all p > .21).

Discussion
This second study investigated whether human morphology plays a role in 3- and 5-yearolds’ choice of an informant in the selective trust paradigm. Despite manipulating human
morphology by using a non-human-looking robot, the findings of Study 2 mirror those of
Study 1. Children competently knew to ask the robot for help in learning novel object labels,
and they responded correctly (knew who was right versus wrong) on the familiarization
judgment trials. Despite Cozmo’s lack of human appearance, the 3-year-old children in our
sample still readily endorsed Cozmo’s labels during half of the test trials. This suggests that
the agency characteristics of the robot (speech, goal-directness), not its human appearance,
were most likely the key characteristics guiding 3-year-olds evaluations of the informants.
Importantly, the 5-year-olds, like in Study 1, continued to endorse the accurate agent,
providing an even more conservative test of epistemic trust.
The 3-year-olds were not accurate at categorizing Cozmo’s internal properties,
although they tended towards assigning more mechanical insides than biological insides
to Cozmo. However, as this result is only trending and the scores do not differ
significantly from those for a humanoid robot, Nao, human morphology does not
seem to be a main criterion guiding children’s decision-making on whether a robot is
either mechanical or biological. In contrast, the 5-year-olds correctly assigned
a mechanical inside to Cozmo, like they did with Nao in Study 1. Interestingly, naïve
biology was found to predict selective trust performance, specifically on the endorse
trial, when the samples of Study 1 and Study 2 were combined. So, while small in effect,
there does seem to be a connection between the performance on the two tasks. Better
categorization of robots as mechanical artifacts seems to slightly better predict learning
from a competent robot. However, this effect is most likely driven by age, as competence
increases on both tasks from 3 to 5 years.
Regarding the parental report measures, the CPBQ was again found to have little effect
on children’s selective trust performance. Even with a large, combined sample, only
correlations between the judgment trials and prosociality were observed. Important to
note is that this effect did not hold in either of the general models. A stronger correlation
was found between the selective trust trials (ask, endorse, and, judgment) and the CSUS.
However, this relationship does not survive in the SEM model. Therefore, only a very weak
positive correlation can be claimed, with greater ToM skills related to better learning from
the robot.

General discussion
A recent meta-analysis based on a large body of studies on selective trust has found that the
effects of informants’ epistemic characteristics are moderated by children’s age, with
children beginning to prioritize epistemic (e.g., expertise, accuracy) over social (e.g., speech,
familiarity) characteristics around the age of 4 years (Tong et al., 2019). The main goal of the
current set of studies was to examine the robustness of epistemic trust by pitting
a competent robot informant against an incompetent human informant. By doing so, we
tested Canadian children’s reliance on a key social characteristic (in-group membership,
“like me” status) against competency.

Trust and informants’ characteristics
To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare a human informant to a robot
informant using the trust paradigm. As predicted, 5-year-old children chose to learn from
a competent robot over an incompetent human. In contrast, our results showed that the
3-year-old children trusted both informants (human and robot) equally. This pattern of
results held whether the robot informant was morphologically similar to a human or not. Of
note, the human informant was Caucasian, making it an in-group member for most of our
sample. As such, the current design provided a conservative test of the ability to attend to
epistemic cues in the trust paradigm. In the present work, whom children chose to trust may
be explained by the fact that the robot displayed characteristics of a social agent in both
studies. For example, both Cozmo and Nao spoke with intonation, pointed to the objects as
they were being labeled, engaged in turn-taking, and moved autonomously. In addition,
Nao also stood upright and possessed human-like features (e.g., eyes, head). A recent study
demonstrated that 3-year-olds consider Nao a psychological agent (e.g., Nao can think for
itself) when displaying the same agency characteristics as in the present work (Brink &
Wellman, 2020). Thus, for 5-year-olds, the competent informant displayed both epistemic
and social characteristics, so the decision of whom to trust was straightforward. In contrast,
because younger children are unable to prioritize epistemic characteristics, their decision
was challenging as both informants possessed social characteristics that children consider
when making such a determination (e.g., in group membership for the person and agency
characteristics for the robot).
The finding that the absence of human morphology did not affect 3-year-old children’s
trust judgments was unexpected, given previous work that shows that children prefer to
interact with agents similar to themselves, including robots (van Straten, Peter, & Kühne,
2020) and that morphology affects children’s perceptions of robots (Fong, Nourbakhsh, &
Dautenhahn, 2003). However, in the context of word learning, goal-directedness and speech
may be the most important characteristics for 3-year-olds to consider when deciding which
informant to trust. This finding becomes especially salient when one considers that the
present studies were conducted online with pre-recorded videos. The fact that the two
robots, Nao and Cozmo, greatly differed in size and appearance further validates our test of
epistemic trust as conservative. Interestingly, previous research on ToM has shown that
agency cues are powerful in guiding the attribution of mental states in children as well as in
adults (Klin, 2000). For example, infants react similarly to a human agent and a mechanical
crane in tests of false belief understanding (Burnside, Severdija, & Poulin-Dubois, 2019).
It is not possible to conclude with certainty whether children selected the robot because it
was a novel and unusual informant or because they truly judged the robot as being more
competent. We believe the first interpretation is unlikely for several reasons. First, if novelty
was driving young children’s responses, 3-year-olds would have overwhelmingly endorsed
the robot, given their reported limited exposure to robots. Second, we believe that the
variable performance on the ask versus endorse trials suggests that novelty is an unlikely
strategy in this context. Both age groups performed well on the ask trials, but only the
5-year-olds endorsed the competent robot informant. Thus, it’s possible that the ask trials
may reflect a novelty bias for the robot, whereas the endorse trials are targeting learning and
trust judgment. Specifically, the ask questions (“who do you want to ask what this is
called?”) is not measuring any learning from the informants. In fact, children could have

22

A.-E. BAUMANN ET AL.

interpreted this question as simply selecting which informant they want to ask for more
information or which informant they wanted to interact with. This could be driven by
curiosity or novelty rather than competency or accuracy. In contrast, the endorse questions
clearly ask the child to endorse the competent informant (“what do you think this is
called?”). In other words, there is less ambiguity and fewer ways to interpret the endorse
question.
The present findings confirm that children can learn from inanimate social agents like
robots. Robots occupy an interesting intermediate position between biological and mechan­
ical entities (van Straten et al., 2020). Specifically, though not alive (i.e., a biological entity),
robots have characteristics of both biological and mechanical objects. Like in the present
studies, robots often look and act like social agents (e.g., speaking, gesturing), so they are
conceptualized as depictions of social agents (Clark & Fischer, 2022). This appears to be the
case regardless of the appearance of the robot, as shown by the fact that the 3-year-olds
treated both robots as equally trustworthy. One novel way to measure children’s concep­
tualizing of robots was to administer a naïve biology task that requires children to infer the
inside of novel animals and artifacts. When shown a static picture of the robot, children
were asked whether something biological (e.g., heart) or mechanical (e.g., gears) belonged
inside. This naïve biology task has revealed a progression with age in inferring the parts that
belong to unfamiliar artifacts and animals (Gottfried & Gelman, 2005). Important to note is
the fact that we replicate the results of Gottfried and Gelman (2005) for animals and
artifacts, confirming the validity of the task in this study. With age, we predicted that
children would become better at categorizing the robot as mechanical, and the results
support this prediction. Although the 3-year-olds associated both Nao and Cozmo with
mechanical or biological insides equally, 5-year-olds overwhelmingly associated both robots
with mechanical insides. It is worth noting that in both experiments, 5-year-olds classified
the robot as mechanical but still chose to learn from it over an incompetent human. This
finding confirms the robustness of the bias for epistemic characteristics at 5 years of age, as
outlined in Heinrich and Broesch (2011), and provides evidence that children at this age
perceive the robot as a depiction of a social agent, much like adults do (Clark & Fischer,
2022). Furthermore, children’s ratings of the robot as mechanical correlated positively with
children’s performance on the selective trust task. With age, children got more competent at
both tasks, and children’s categorization of the robot weakly predicted better selective trust
performance. Interesting to note, however, is the fact that age still only accounts for 9% of
our variance, as shown by the linear regressions. Therefore, factors we did not measure,
such as parenting style or school/daycare attendance, may further explain this shift from
social to epistemic trust. This is an area to explore in future research. What, besides age,
contributes to this shift?
Exploratory analyses
For our exploratory goals, we aimed to identify individual differences in socio-cognitive
skills that could predict epistemic trust. Specifically, we investigated prosocial and ToM
skills using parental report measures, the CPBQ and CSUS, respectively. We expected that
individual variability in the tendency to choose the incompetent human informant would
be explained by stronger social affiliation whereas ToM skills would contribute to the
successful identification of the competent informant. Across both studies, however, only

JOURNAL OF COGNITION AND DEVELOPMENT

23

weak, and inconclusive, correlational links were found. Due to the inconsistency and lack of
statistical strength found in the correlations, we ran two overall models: a linear regression
and a structural equation model. We ran these models in the hope of clarifying our
correlational findings and investigating the strength of the effects found through correla­
tions between the selective trust task and the CSUS or CPBQ. No links survived in the
overall models run. One reason for these null results might be the use of parental reports.
Although a well validated measure of theory of mind, the CSUS has so far yielded only
a weak or no link with performance in the selective trust paradigm (Brosseau-Liard et al.,
2015; Dutemple, Hakimi, & Poulin-Dubois, 2022; Resendes et al., 2021). A replication of the
present study with a direct measure of theory of mind would be beneficial. With regard to
the measure of social affiliation, the CPBQ may not have been the best measure to use, as it
is validated for age 3, but not for age 5. While the CPBQ is a reliable measure of prosociality,
it lacks questions broadly measuring social affiliation, which may have been helpful in
explaining children’s trust decisions in the above-described studies. For example, a child
might display low prosociality but still prefer interacting with agents more like them
(people), as opposed to robots or other technological devices. Future studies will be needed
to explore this issue more directly, including direct measures of in-group biases as well.
Given the absence of link between theory of mind and epistemic trust, one might wonder
if children who preferred to learn from the robots perceived it as sentient. We believe so.
There is ample evidence to support children’s attributing mental states to robots. For
example, Manzi et al. (2020) found that 5-year-olds attribute mental states (i.e., emotions,
perceptions) to the Nao robot. Therefore, we are confident that 5-year-old children learned
from the robot because they were guided by epistemic trust, and, in turn, the children
viewed this robot informant as a depiction of a social agent.
Limitations and future directions
The present work has several further limitations that future research can address. One of the
limitations was that online testing sometimes made it more difficult to control for inter­
ferences and distractions in the testing environment. To control for this potential con­
founding variable, distracted children were excluded from our sample. One way to address
this limitation would be to conduct future work in the laboratory to maximize attentiveness
and minimize technical difficulties. Replicating the present work in the laboratory would
also increase the ecological validity. Most of the time, children interact with social robots
like Cozmo or Nao in person and not through online videos and computer screens. The
morphological features of the robots would also be more visible in person. Nonetheless,
there are also some advantages to online testing, such as a faster data collection process, the
ability to reach a greater range of families resulting in a more diverse sample, and making it
easier for families to participate in research. Using pre-recorded videos ensured internal
consistency as each child saw the exact same videos, and the informants behaved in the
exact same way, reducing experimenter error. However, if administered live, it is possible
the 3-year-olds would have learned more from the human speaker Ina rather than the robot.
As the present work featured a competent robot and an incompetent human, an interesting
follow-up study would be to examine children’s trust judgments when both the human and
the robot behave accurately. We would predict that younger children would learn more
from the human due to its familiarity and the impact of in-group bias in previous research

24

on selective trust, whereas older children would be expected to learn equally from both
informants if epistemic cues guide their decision-making.
Future research should focus on manipulating the types of social cues informants display
during social interactions. In the present set of studies, except for animacy, the two
informants exhibited the same types of agency characteristics. Both the human informant
Ina and the robot informants (Nao in Study 1, Cozmo in Study 2) spoke with intonation,
pointed to the objects as they labeled them, and engaged in turn-taking (i.e., not speaking
over one another). Having one informant display many agency characteristics while the
other displays fewer could help tease out what role they play in younger children’s decisions
about whom to learn from. For example, future work could eliminate speech, which is
a powerful agency characteristic, by having the robot informant show competence in
performing actions (e.g., building a tower) or by showing more reliability in
a communicative context (e.g., pointing to the correct location in a hiding game). Future
work could also administer an interview to older children, comparing their choice of agent
or inside with their verbal description and categorization of the robots. This would allow us
to contrast two tasks of categorization (naïve biology task and interviews).
In conclusion, the present work contributes to the current literature by being the first
study to compare a human to a robot informant, as most prior work has only tested
selective trust with two robots (Breazeal et al., 2016; Brink & Wellman, 2020) or two
human informants (Tong et al., 2019). Moreover, the present study examined trust with
two different robots that varied in their human appearance. These findings demonstrate
that young children can identify the competence of both human and non-human
informants by 5 years of age. These findings have important implications for the use
of robots in educational settings. As children’s exposure to robots is increasing (de Jong,
Peter, Kühne, & Barco, 2021), it is beneficial to examine how children learn from robots
and understand what characteristics children prioritize when choosing the best
informant.
