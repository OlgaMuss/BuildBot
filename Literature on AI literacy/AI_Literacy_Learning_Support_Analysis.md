## Recommendations for Curriculum Enhancement

### Priority Areas for Development:

1. **Add Learning Enhancement Modules:**
   - How to use AI for personalized study
   - AI tools for skill development
   - Strategies for leveraging AI in different subjects

2. **Integrate Human Development Content:**
   - AI's role in supporting metacognitive development
   - Building resilience through AI-assisted learning
   - Developing critical thinking with AI tools

3. **Include Self-Regulated Learning Components:**
   - Using AI to monitor learning progress
   - Setting learning goals with AI assistance
   - Reflecting on learning with AI support

4. **Develop Practical Applications:**
   - Hands-on activities using AI for learning
   - Case studies of successful AI-supported learning
   - Evaluation frameworks for AI learning tools

## Conclusion

While some AI literacy curriculums (particularly newer ones like aiEDU's framework) are beginning to address how AI can support learning and human development, there remains a significant gap in most existing programs. The evidence supports the original statement that this is indeed a missing element in most AI literacy education, representing an important opportunity for curriculum enhancement and development.
