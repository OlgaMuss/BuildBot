Abstract
This study investigates the degree to which children anthropomorphize a robot tutor
and whether this anthropomorphism relates to their vocabulary learning in a secondlanguage (L2) tutoring intervention. With this aim, an anthropomorphism questionnaire
was administered to 5-year-old children (N = 104) twice: prior to and following a sevensession L2 vocabulary training with a humanoid robot. On average, children tended to
anthropomorphize the robot prior to and after the lessons to a similar degree, but many
children changed their attributed anthropomorphic features. Boys anthropomorphized

positive correlation between anthropomorphism as measured before the lessons and
scores on a word-knowledge post-test administered the day after the last lesson. There
was also a weak but significant positive correlation between the change in anthropomately 2 weeks after the last lesson. Our results underscore the need to manage
children's expectations in robot-assisted education. Also, future research could explore
adaptations to individual children's expectations in child-robot interactions.

ging, the robot would count in English the number of animals in

During these tasks, the robot acted as a slightly more knowledgeable peer who was also being taught English words, but could provide
feedback on the child's actions when needed. For example, when a
child dragged the wrong animal to a cage on the tablet, the robot
could ask the child to drag the correct animal to the cage. See Table 1
for an example of the child and robot interaction.
The lessons were designed without relying on children's speech
because speech recognition is currently still unreliable with children
(Kennedy et al., 2017). For the few times children had to repeat a
word, a Wizard of Oz was used where the researcher pressed a button on a control panel after the child had repeated after the robot.
The rest of the interaction was carried out autonomously. The interaction was one-on-one in a separate room, but the experimenter stayed
in the same room to intervene when necessary and to control the
Wizard.

Robot behaviour

During the sessions, the robot was in breathing-mode (moving with its
arms) to appear more lively. As the robot motors can be quite loud
when the robot moves, the breathing-mode also reduced the initial
sound shock when the robot was going to make a gesture and moved
up its arms. In both conditions, the robot used deictic gestures, such
as pointing, to draw the child's attention to the tablet, and head movements to look at the child when the child was asked to perform a certain task on the tablet. The only addition to the iconic + deictic
gesture condition on top of the deictic gesture condition was the
robot's use of iconic gestures. Specifically, an iconic gesture was
designed for each of the included target words, and the robot would
perform this gesture whenever it produced that word in the L2.
Gestures were designed using key framing (Pot, Monceaux,

positive and moderately strong correlation between scores before the
tutoring sessions and after the tutoring sessions on the anthropomorphism questionnaire, r(104) = 0.505, p < .001, indicating moderate
overall stability of anthropomorphism. However, there was also large
variability among the children in whether and how the degree to
which they anthropomorphized the robot changed before and after
the tutoring sessions. Most children were consistent in the degree to
which they anthropomorphized the robot (45 children), that is, their
anthropomorphism scores during the two test moments were the
same or differed by a maximum of one question. However, a relatively
large number of children anthropomorphized the robot less after having interacted with it in the tutoring sessions (35 children). An increase
in anthropomorphism also occurred, but was least common
(24 children).
We compared children's answers on the anthropomorphism questionnaire after the tutoring sessions to their answers before the
tutoring sessions. Table 2 shows that children changed their opinion
drastically on a number of questions. Fewer children believed after
the tutoring sessions that the robot could feel it when being tickled,
that it could feel pain, or that it could be sad. More children believed
after the tutoring sessions that the robot could understand what they
said, and that the robot could recognize them. However, a paired samples t-test did not show significant differences between children's
overall scores before and after the tutoring sessions on the anthropomorphism questionnaire, t(103) = 1.53, p = .130, d = 0.15.

The study presented in this article explored the degree to which children anthropomorphize a social robot, whether this had changed after
seven tutoring sessions, and whether anthropomorphism correlated
with children's word knowledge after these sessions. We found that
children generally anthropomorphized the robot, although there were
large differences between children in the degree to which they did.
Our results showed that children's overall tendency to anthropomorphize had not significantly changed after the tutoring sessions, but the
analysis at the item level revealed a complex pattern of changes indicating a shift within this overall tendency towards seeing the robot as
more mechanical while at the same time attributing more cognitive
capabilities to the robot. As an exploration, we found a weak but significant correlation between children's increased anthropomorphism
and their word knowledge. Children who came to perceive the robot
more as a human knew more words after the tutoring sessions.
Although the causal direction of this relation is not yet clear, the
results underscore the importance of taking children's anthropomorphism into consideration when designing robot-assisted tutoring
sessions.
