SHORT SUMMARY

Can technology solve the most important
challenges in education?
The adoption of digital technology has resulted in many changes in education
and learning, yet it is debatable whether technology has transformed education
as many claim. The application of digital technology varies by community and
socioeconomic level, by teacher willingness and preparedness, by education level
and by country income. Except in the most technologically advanced countries,
computers and devices are not used in classrooms on a large scale. Moreover,
evidence is mixed on its impact. The short- and long-term costs of using digital
technology appear to be significantly underestimated. The most disadvantaged
are typically denied the opportunity to benefit.
In asking ‘A tool on whose terms?’, the Report shows that regulations
for technology set outside of the education sector will not necessarily
address education’s needs. It is released along with a #TechOnOurTerms
campaign, calling for decisions about technology in education to
prioritize learner needs after assessment of whether its application
would be appropriate, equitable, evidence-based and sustainable.

It would cost
USD 1 billion per
day to maintain
connectivity for
education in poor
countries

It provides a compass for policy makers to use when making these
decisions. Those in decision-making positions are asked to look down
at where they are, to see if technology is appropriate for their context,
and learning needs. They are asked to look back at those left behind, to make
sure they are focusing on the marginalized. They are reminded to look up at whether
they have evidence on impact and enough information on the full cost needed to make
informed decisions. And, finally they are asked to look forwards, to make sure their
plans fit their vision for sustainable development.

The report underscores the importance of learning to live both with and without digital
technology; to take what is needed from an abundance of information but ignore what
is not necessary; to let technology support, but never supplant, the human connection
on which teaching and learning are based. The focus should be on learning outcomes,
not digital inputs. To help improve learning, digital technology should be not a substitute
for but a complement to face-to-face interaction with teachers.
Supporting the sixth Global Education Monitoring Report is a new series of country profiles
on PEER, a policy dialogue resource describing policies and regulations related to
technology in the world’s education systems.

Since wars begin in the minds of men and
women, it is in the minds of men and women that
the defenses of peace must be constructed

Foreword
During the COVID-19 pandemic, distance-learning tools – via the Internet but also via radio and television – showed just
how useful and necessary they could be. However, they also revealed their limits.
Indeed, this period highlighted a deep-rooted tendency to see technological solutions as a universal tool, suitable for all
situations, an inevitable form of progress. This confusion between the tool and the solution, between the means and the
end, is what this report invites us to address, by highlighting three paradoxes – three popular misconceptions.
Firstly, there is the promise of personalized learning. Very often, this powerful hope leads us to forget the fundamental
social and human dimension that lies at the heart of education. It is worth reiterating the obvious: no screen can ever
replace the humanity of a teacher. As underlined in the UNESCO ‘Futures of Education’ report, published in 2021,
the relationship between teachers and technology must be one of complementarity – never of substitutability.
While technology promises easier access to education, the reality is that digital divides still exist, to the point of actually
increasing educational inequalities – which is the second paradox that this report highlights. During the pandemic, almost
a third of pupils did not have effective access to distance learning – unsurprisingly, since only 40% of primary schools
worldwide currently have Internet access. Even if connectivity was universal, it would still be necessary to demonstrate,
from a pedagogical point of view, that digital technology offers real added value in terms of effective learning, especially
at a time when we are all becoming aware of the risks of excessive screen time.
The last paradox, and by no means the least, is that, despite the desire to make education a global common good, the role
of commercial and private interests in education continues to grow, with all the ambiguities that entails: to date, only one
in seven countries legally guarantees the privacy of educational data.
These three pitfalls can be avoided, which is why our report makes two strong recommendations that should serve as a
compass. Firstly, it recommends that the best interests of pupils should systematically take precedence over any other
consideration – particularly commercial considerations. Secondly, it recommends that technology should be seen as a
means, never an end.
To make these recommendations reality, UNESCO is calling on its Member States to ensure the fair, equitable and safe
development of educational technologies. This means establishing appropriate normative frameworks and setting
standards in terms of privacy, access to data, non-discrimination and screen time. It also means launching ambitious
public action and international cooperation programmes, to support access to connectivity and open educational
resources, and to train teachers on these new and constantly evolving issues.
The conclusions of this report are therefore a starting point to build on, in particular by identifying teaching methods that
really work remotely and by continuing research on these subjects to inform public action. Always with the same goal in
mind: ensuring that technology serves education, not the other way round.

Foreword
Education and technological innovation are intrinsically interlinked. New ideas lead to digital transformation, which feeds
back in turn to help us improve education systems. Together, education and technology can lead to holistic system-level
quality improvement and greater equity.
Before becoming Minister, my education led me to work with multiple technologies to develop prosthetic sockets for
amputees, a system that enables people to walk with greater comfort; to walk to school and on through life. My role then
as both Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education and as Chief Innovation Officer for the Government of Sierra
Leone continued to draw on this link and the benefits that can come from imagining technology as an enabler.
This report highlights the extent to which the relationship between education and technology is delicate, however,
in particular digital technology. Understanding when and how to use and not to use technology to serve our educational
objectives is becoming a critical skill for 21st century education leaders. There are multiple benefits, for instance, that
come from handling the data generated by education systems and using it to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
our education systems to cater for the education needs of all children.
In Sierra Leone, we understand this. Data brought by technology can give us a picture of the health of our education
system, just as it can help us make sure that the learning journeys of each and every child is on the right path. Our push for
radical inclusion is not only fuelled by, but depends upon data. We count everyone so that no one is left out. Our EdTech
strategy is firmly synchronized with our long-term vision of delivering inclusive, quality education for all learners and
teachers.
When it works well, the data we generate in our education system is the best guide for the policies we need to implement
to make things better. This is true for policy makers as it is for teachers, school directors, teachers, parents and
communities. Our leaders in primary schools are now prepared to use tablets to collect and apply dynamic data to manage
their schools; to oversee teacher registration, student enrolment and attendance.
There are benefits in speed and efficiency. This includes building systems based on unique student and school identifiers
as we have done since 2018. Our digitized annual school census can flag up an issue far faster than many physical
inspection visits could do - albeit we need both.
Problem areas such as inequality in school and inefficient resource distribution can also be prevented if we can visualize
their resolution. This report reminds us that the use of geospatial data does just that. It remains nascent in low- and
lower-middle-income countries, even though it is needed there the most. In Sierra Leone, we are looking at ways of
maximizing these innovations with a GIS tool that considers new school locations based on poverty, population and flood
risk data. It identifies where we have blind spots; where we could improve; and where we could learn.
Efficiency benefits can also come in some instances from technology’s ability to roll out policy reforms far and fast.
Increasingly, this report documents, countries are buying into the undeniable advantages that come from using
technology for teacher professional development, for instance. This breaks down barriers related to location or time; it
is cost-effective, fosters teacher-to-teacher collaboration and improves teaching practices. In Sierra Leone, we combine
audio, visual and digital resources with printed workbooks to enhance teacher training and bring excitement around
technology’s potential into pedagogy from the start.
But this report also shows that seamlessly moving to a new tech-savvy system of management is not always easy or
cheap. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there is a gap between the expected benefits of technology on education management
and their realization. Seemingly trivial issues such as maintenance and repair of infrastructure can be ignored or
underestimated. Sometimes the very objective of improving learning is forgotten when learning analytics are designed.
We may forget to account for our capacity and resources.

Building systems informed by data that use dashboards, charts and tables also assumes an ability to absorb this level of
change, including strong school leaders and confident teachers who are willing to innovate. It requires a broad range of
people who are data literate, which is far from the case in many contexts.
The one thing around which we all unite is that there are so many tools, so many players, different operating systems and
so much conflicting research on what works, it can make you dizzy. I am therefore pleased to see the collaboration with
partners such as the EdTech Hub in this report, bringing together strong parties whose daily work is about the importance
of evidence for decision-making.
As Chair of the Advisory Board for the GEM Report, I urge all policy makers to read this report carefully and to compare
your PEER country profile against others. Most of all, as the spread of technology, especially generative AI, continues
to seep into our sector, I encourage everyone to apply its recommendations. There are too many risks from not doing
so. If we are to be tech-savvy, we must be savvy about the education systems we want to create. I support the
#TechOnOurTerms campaign. Our SDG 4 terms are non-negotiable.

Glossary
Attainment rate. Number of persons in a particular
age group by the highest level of education completed,
expressed as a percentage of the total population in that
age group (see Completion rate).
Age-specific enrolment ratio. Enrolment of a given age
or age group, regardless of the level of education in
which pupils or students are enrolled, expressed as a
percentage of the population of the same age or age group.
An example is global indicator 4.2.2, the participation rate
in organized learning (one year before the official primary
entry age).
Completion rate. Percentage of children aged three to five
years older than the official age of entry into the last grade
of an education level who have reached the last grade of
that level. For example, the primary completion rate in a
country with a 6-year cycle where the official age of entry
into the last grade is 11 years is the percentage of 14- to
16-year-olds who have reached grade 6.
Conflict-affected country. For a given year, any country
with 1,000 or more battle-related deaths (including
fatalities among civilians and military actors) over the
preceding 10-year period and/or more than 200 battlerelated deaths in any 1 year over the preceding 3-year
period, according to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program
Battle-Related Deaths Dataset.
Constant price. Price of an item adjusted to remove the
overall effect of general price changes (inflation) since a
given baseline year.
Early childhood care and education. Services and
programmes that support children’s survival, growth,
development and learning – including health, nutrition
and hygiene, and cognitive, social, emotional and physical
development – from birth to entry into primary school.
Early Childhood Development Index. Index of fulfilment
of developmental potential that assesses children aged
36-59 months in four domains: literacy/numeracy,
and physical, social-emotional and cognitive development.
The information is collected through the UNICEF Multiple
Indicator Cluster Surveys. A child is ‘on track’ overall if
they are ‘on track’ in at least three of the four domains.
The index has been revised but is not yet used.

Education levels according to the International Standard
Classification of Education (ISCED), which is the
classification system designed to serve as an instrument
for assembling, compiling and presenting comparable
education indicators and statistics both within countries
and internationally. The system, introduced in 1976,
was revised in 1997 and 2011.










Pre-primary education (ISCED level 0). Programmes at the
initial stage of organized instruction, primarily designed
to introduce very young children, aged at least 3 years,
to a school-type environment and provide a bridge
between home and school. Upon completion of these
programmes, children continue their education at ISCED
1 (primary education).
Primary education (ISCED level 1). Programmes generally
designed to give pupils a sound basic education in
reading, writing and mathematics, and an elementary
understanding of subjects such as history, geography,
sciences, art and music.
Secondary education (ISCED levels 2 and 3). Lower
secondary education (ISCED 2) is generally designed to
continue the basic programmes of the primary level, but
the teaching is typically more subject-focused, requiring
more specialized teachers for each subject area. The end
of this level often coincides with the end of compulsory
education. Teaching in upper secondary education
(ISCED 3) is often organized even more along subject
lines and teachers typically need a higher or more
subject-specific qualification.
Post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED level 4). It
provides learning experiences building on secondary
education, preparing for entry to the labour market as
well as tertiary education.
Tertiary education (ISCED levels 5–8). It builds on
secondary education, providing learning activities in
specialized fields of education. The aim is learning at a
high level of complexity and specialization. It comprises:




Level 5: Short-cycle tertiary education, often
designed to provide participants with professional
knowledge, skills and competences. It is practically
based and occupationally specific and prepares
students to enter the labour market.
Level 6: Bachelor’s, often designed to provide
participants with intermediate academic and/or
professional knowledge, skills and competences,
leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification.

xxi





Level 7: Master’s or equivalent level, often designed
to provide participants with advanced academic and/
or professional knowledge, skills and competences,
leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification.
Level 8: Doctoral or equivalent level,
designed primarily to lead to an advanced
research qualification.

Education for sustainable development. A type of
education that enables learners to constructively and
creatively address present and future global challenges
and create more sustainable and resilient societies.
Global citizenship education. A type of education that
empowers learners to assume active roles to face
and resolve global challenges and become proactive
contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and
secure world.
Gross domestic product (GDP). The value of all final goods
and services produced in a country in one year.
Gross enrolment ratio. Enrolment in a specific level of
education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage
of the population in the official age group corresponding to
this level of education. It can exceed 100% because of early
or late entry and/or grade repetition.
Gross intake rate. Total number of new entrants to a given
grade of primary education, regardless of age, expressed
as a percentage of the population at the official school
entrance age for that grade.

Literacy. According to UNESCO’s 1958 definition, the term
refers to the ability of an individual to read and write with
understanding a simple short statement related to their
everyday life. The concept of literacy has since evolved to
embrace several skill domains, each conceived on a scale of
different mastery levels and serving different purposes.
Literacy rate. Number of literate people in a particular age
group, expressed as a percentage of the total population in
that age group.


Adult. Aged 15 and above



Youth. Aged 15-24.

Minimum proficiency level. Benchmark of basic knowledge
in mathematics and reading, measured through learning
assessments. Until such time as common standards are
validated by the international community or countries
validate common standards, the definitions of minimum
proficiency published by agencies specialized in
cross-national learning assessments are being used.
Net attendance rate. Number of students in the official age
group for a given level of education who attend school at
that level, expressed as a percentage of the population in
that age group.
Net enrolment rate. Enrolment of the official age group for
a given level of education, expressed as a percentage of
the population in that age group. There are two additional
variations of this indicator:


Gross national income. The value of all final goods and
services produced in a country in one year (GDP) plus
income that residents have received from abroad minus
income claimed by non-residents.
Information and communication technology skills.
Individuals are considered to have such skills if they have
undertaken certain computer-related activities in the last
three months: copying or moving a file or folder; using copy
and paste tools to duplicate or move information within a
document; sending emails with attached files; using basic
arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet; connecting and
installing new devices; finding, downloading, installing and
configuring software; creating electronic presentations
with presentation software; transferring files between
a computer and other devices; and writing a computer
program using a specialized programming language.



Adjusted net enrolment rate. Enrolment of the official
age group for a given level of education either at that
level or the levels above, expressed as a percentage of the
population in that age group.
Total net enrolment rate. Enrolment of the official age
group in any level of education, expressed as a percentage
of the population in that age group.

New entrants. Students entering a given level of education
for the first time; the difference between enrolment and
repeaters in the first grade of the level.
Never been to school rate. Percentage of children aged
three to five years older than the official entrance age
into primary education who have never been to school.
For example, in a country where the official entrance
age is 6 years, the indicator is calculated over the 9- to
11-year-old age group.

Out-of-school number. Those not enrolled, defined over
the following populations:


Children of official primary school age



Adolescents of official lower secondary school age



Youth of official upper secondary school age.

Out-of-school rate. Those of the official age group for
a given level of education not enrolled, expressed as a
percentage of the population in that age group.
Over-age for grade rate. The percentage of students in
each level of education (primary, lower secondary and
upper secondary) who are two years or more older than
the intended age for their grade.
Parity index. A measure of inequality defined as the
ratio of the values of an education indicator of two
population groups. Typically, the numerator is the value
of the disadvantaged group and the denominator is the
value of the advantaged group. A value between 0.97 and
1.03 indicates parity. A value below 0.97 indicates
disparity in favour of the advantaged group. A value above
1.03 indicates disparity in favour of the disadvantaged
group. An adjusted parity index is symmetrical around
1 and limited to a range between 0 and 2. Groups can be
defined by:






Gender. Ratio of female to male values of a given
indicator
Location. Ratio of rural to urban values of a given
indicator
Wealth/income. Ratio of the poorest 20% to the richest
20% of a given indicator.

by public authorities but are controlled and managed,
whether for profit or not, by private bodies such as
non-governmental organizations, religious bodies, special
interest groups, foundations or business enterprises.
Public expenditure on education. Total current and capital
expenditure on education by local, regional and national
governments for public and private institutions.
Pupil/teacher ratio. Average number of pupils per teacher
at a specific level of education.

qualification necessary to teach at a specific level of
education in a given country.
Teacher attrition rate. Number of teachers at a given level
of education leaving the profession in a given school year,
expressed as a percentage of teachers at that level and in
that school year.
Technical and vocational education and training.

direct entry into a particular occupation or trade (or class of
occupations or trades).
Trained teacher. Teacher who has fulfilled at least the
minimum organized teacher-training requirements (pre
service or in-service) to teach a specific level of education
according to national policy or law.
Transition rate. Number of new entrants to the first
grade of an education level in a given year, expressed
as a percentage of the number of students who were
enrolled in the final grade of the previous education level
the previous year and who do not repeat that grade the
following year.

KEY MESSAGES
Good, impartial evidence on the impact of education technology is in short supply.




There is little robust evidence on digital technology’s added value in education. Technology evolves faster than it is
possible to evaluate it: Education technology products change every 36 months, on average. Most evidence comes
from the richest countries. In the United Kingdom, 7% of education technology companies had conducted randomized
controlled trials, and 12% had used third-party certification. A survey of teachers and administrators in 17 US states
showed that only 11% requested peer-reviewed evidence prior to adoption.
A lot of the evidence comes from those trying to sell it. Pearson funded its own studies, contesting independent
analysis that showed its products had no impact.

Technology offers an education lifeline for millions but excludes many more.








Accessible technology and universal design have opened up opportunities for learners with disabilities. About 87% of
visually impaired adults indicated that accessible technology devices were replacing traditional assistive tools.
Radio, television and mobile phones fill in for traditional education among hard-to-reach populations. Almost 40
countries use radio instruction. In Mexico, a programme of televised lessons combined with in-class support increased
secondary school enrolment by 21%.
Online learning stopped education from melting down during COVID-19 school closures. Distance learning had
a potential reach of over 1 billion students; but it also failed to reach at least half a billion, or 31% of students
worldwide – and 72% of the poorest.
The right to education is increasingly synonymous with the right to meaningful connectivity, yet access is unequal.
Globally, only 40% of primary, 50% of lower secondary and 65% of upper secondary schools are connected to the
internet; 85% of countries have policies to improve school or learner connectivity.

Some education technology can improve some types of learning in some contexts.










3

Digital technology has dramatically increased access to teaching and learning resources. Examples include the
National Academic Digital Library of Ethiopia and National Digital Library of India. The Teachers Portal in Bangladesh
has over 600,000 users.
It has brought small to medium-sized positive effects to some types of learning. A review of 23 mathematics
applications used at the primary level showed that they focused on drill and practice rather than advanced skills.
But it should focus on learning outcomes, not on digital inputs. In Peru, when over 1 million laptops were distributed
without being incorporated into pedagogy, learning did not improve. In the United States, analysis of over 2 million
students found that learning gaps widened when instruction was exclusively remote.
And it need not be advanced to be effective. In China, high-quality lesson recordings delivered to 100 million rural
students improved student outcomes by 32% and reduced urban–rural earning gaps by 38%.
Finally, it can have detrimental impact if inappropriate or excessive. Large-scale international assessment data, such
as that provided by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), suggest a negative link between
excessive ICT use and student performance. Mere proximity to a mobile device was found to distract students and to
have a negative impact on learning in 14 countries, yet less than one in four have banned smartphone use in schools.

KEY MESSAGES

The fast pace of change in technology is putting strain on education systems to adapt.








Countries are starting to define the digital skills they want to prioritize in curricula and assessment standards.
Globally, 54% of countries have digital skill standards but often these have been defined by non-state, mostly
commercial, actors.
Many students do not have much chance to practise with digital technology in schools. Even in the world’s richest
countries, only about 10% of 15-year-old students used digital devices for more than an hour per week in mathematics
and science.
Teachers often feel unprepared and lack confidence teaching with technology. Only half of countries have standards
for developing teacher ICT skills. While 5% of ransomware attacks target education, few teacher training programmes
cover cybersecurity.
Various issues impede the potential of digital data in education management. Many countries lack capacity: Just over
half of countries use student identification numbers. Countries that do invest in data struggle: A recent survey among
UK universities found that 43% had trouble linking data systems.

Online content has grown without enough regulation of quality control or diversity.




Online content is produced by dominant groups, affecting access to it. Nearly 90% of content in higher education
repositories with open education resource collections was created in Europe and Northern America; 92% of content in
the OER Commons global library is in English. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) mainly benefit educated learners
and those from richer countries.
Higher education is adopting digital technology the fastest and being transformed by it the most. There were over
220 million students attending MOOCs in 2021. But digital platforms challenge universities’ role and pose regulatory
and ethical challenges, for instance related to exclusive subscription deals and to student and personnel data.

Technology is often bought to plug a gap, with no view to the long-term costs…






…for national budgets. The cost of moving to basic digital learning in low-income countries and connecting all schools
to the internet in lower-middle-income countries would add 50% to their current financing gap for achieving national
SDG 4 targets. Money is not always well spent: Around two-thirds of education software licences were unused in the
United States.
…for children’s well-being. Children’s data are being exposed, yet only 16% of countries explicitly guarantee data privacy
in education by law. One analysis found that 89% of 163 education technology products recommended during the
pandemic could survey children. Further, 39 of 42 governments providing online education during the pandemic fostered
uses that risked or infringed on children’s rights.
…for the planet. One estimate of the CO2 emissions that could be saved by extending the lifespan of all laptops in the
European Union by a year found it would be equivalent to taking almost 1 million cars off the road.

Introduction

KE Y MESSAGES
Digital technology has changed but not transformed education.
Digital technology tools have been widely adopted by learners, educators and institutions.


The number of students in massive open online courses reached at least 220 million in 2021. The learning
application Duolingo had 20 million daily active users in 2023 and Wikipedia had 244 million page views per day in
2021. Globally, the percentage of internet users rose from 16% in 2005 to 66% in 2022.

The adoption of digital technology has resulted in many changes in education and learning.


The set of basic skills that young people are expected to learn in school has expanded to include a broad range
of new ones to navigate the digital world. Higher education is the subsector with the highest rate of digital
technology adoption, with online management platforms replacing some campuses. The use of data analytics has
grown in education management. Technology has made a wide range of informal learning opportunities accessible.



But in many parts of the world, education systems remain relatively untouched. Even in some of the most
technologically advanced countries, computers and devices are not used in classrooms on a large scale. Technology
use is not universal and will not become so any time soon.

Can technology help solve the most important challenges in education?


Equity and inclusion: Digital technology lowers education access cost for some disadvantaged groups, but access
to the internet and devices remains highly unequal.



Quality: Digital technology encourages engagement and facilitates collaboration and connections, but an
individualized approach to education reduces learners’ opportunities to learn in real-life settings and has a
negative impact on well-being and privacy.



Efficiency: Digital technology reduces the time teachers and students spend on menial tasks, time that can be used
in other, educationally more meaningful activities.

How do we know whether technology works in education?


Technology is evolving too fast to permit evaluations that could inform decisions on legislation, policy and
regulation. Findings that apply in some contexts are not always replicable elsewhere. Few questions are asked
about who is shaping the discourse that says technology is the answer to major education challenges.



Artificial intelligence has been applied in education for the past 40 years. More evidence is needed to understand
whether its tools can change how students learn, beyond the superficial level of obtaining answers and correcting
mistakes.

What do countries focus on when they invest in education technology?


Every country has invested in the use of digital technology in education to some extent. Business rather than
education arguments are more commonly deployed to justify countries’ investments. Often investments are based
on a belief that technology is a good in itself.

ajor advances in technology, especially digital
technology, are rapidly transforming the world.
Information and communication technology (ICT)
has been used for 100 years in education, ever since the
popularization of radio in the 1920s. But it is the use of
digital technology over the past 40 years that has the most
significant potential to transform education. An education
technology industry has emerged and focused, in turn,
on the development and distribution of education content,
learning management systems, language applications,
augmented and virtual reality, personalized tutoring,
and testing. Most recently, breakthroughs in artificial
intelligence (AI) methods have increased the power of
education technology tools, leading to speculation that
technology could even supplant human interaction in
education (Box 1.1).

In the past 20 years, learners, educators and institutions
have widely adopted digital technology tools. The number
of students in massive open online courses reached at
least 220 million in 2021 (Shah, 2021). The language
learning application Duolingo had 20 million daily
active users in 2023 (Ceci, 2023) and Wikipedia had
244 million page views per day in 2021 (Thomas,
2022). The 2018 Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) found that 65% of 15-year-old students
in OECD countries were in schools whose principals agreed
that teachers had the technical and pedagogical skills to
integrate digital devices in instruction and 54% in schools
where an effective online learning support platform was
available (OECD, 2020c, pp. 266–268); these shares are
believed to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Globally, the percentage of internet users rose from 16% in
2005 to 66% in 2022 (ITU, 2022). About 50% of the world’s
lower secondary schools were connected to the internet
for pedagogical purposes in 2022 (UIS, 2023). Although
digital technology has been used in poorer countries,

and among some of the most marginalized people in the
world, its use in education is still limited.
The adoption of digital technology has resulted in many
changes in education and learning. The set of basic skills
that young people are expected to learn in school, at least
in richer countries, has expanded to include a broad range
of new ones to navigate the digital world (Vuorikari et al.,
2022). In many classrooms, paper has been replaced by
screens, and pens by keyboards. COVID-19 can be seen
as a natural experiment where learning switched online
for entire education systems virtually overnight (Box 1.2).
Higher education is the subsector with the highest rate
of digital technology adoption, with online management
platforms replacing campuses (Williamson, 2021). The use
of data analytics has grown in education management
(Romero and Ventura, 2020). Technology has made a
wide range of informal learning opportunities accessible
(Greenhow and Lewin, 2015).

The extent to which technology has
transformed education needs to be debated
Yet the extent to which technology has transformed
education needs to be debated (Reich, 2020). Change
resulting from the use of digital technology is incremental,
uneven and bigger in some contexts than in others.
The application of digital technology varies by community
and socioeconomic level, by teacher willingness and
preparedness, by education level, and by country income.
Except in the most technologically advanced countries,
computers and devices are not used in classrooms on a
large scale. Technology use is not universal and will not
become so any time soon. Moreover, evidence is mixed

on its impact (Hamilton and Hattie, 2021). Some types of
technology seem to be effective in improving some kinds
of learning (Selwyn, 2022). The short- and long-term
costs of using digital technology appear to be significantly
underestimated. The most disadvantaged are typically
denied the opportunity to benefit from this technology.
Too much attention on technology in education usually
comes at a high cost. Resources spent on technology,
rather than on classrooms, teachers and textbooks for all
children in low- and lower-middle-income countries lacking
access to these resources, are likely to lead to the world
being further away from achieving the global education
goal, SDG 4. Some of the world’s richest countries ensured
universal secondary schooling and minimum learning
competencies before the advent of digital technology.
Children can learn without it.
However, their education is unlikely to be as relevant
without digital technology. The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights defines the purpose of education as
promoting the ‘full development of the human personality’,
strengthening ‘respect for … fundamental freedoms’
and promoting ‘understanding, tolerance and friendship’.
This notion needs to move with the times. An expanded
definition of the right to education could include effective
support by technology for all learners to fulfil their
potential, regardless of context or circumstance.
Clear objectives and principles are needed to ensure that
technology use is of benefit and avoids harm. The negative
and harmful aspects of the use of digital technology
in education and society include risk of distraction
and lack of human contact. Unregulated technology
even poses threats to democracy and human rights,
for instance through invasion of privacy and stoking of
hatred. Education systems need to be better prepared to
teach about and through digital technology, a tool that
must serve the best interests of all learners, teachers
and administrators. Impartial evidence showing that
technology is being used in some places to improve
education and good examples of such use need to be
shared more widely so that the optimal mode of delivery
can be chosen for each context.

While technology has tremendous potential,
many tools have not been designed for
application to education

CAN TECHNOLOGY HELP SOLVE THE
MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGES IN
EDUCATION?
Discussions about education technology are focused
on technology rather than education. The first question
should be: What are the most important challenges in
education? As a basis for discussion, consider the following
three challenges:






Equity and inclusion: Is fulfilment of the right to
choose the education one wants and to realize one’s
full potential through education compatible with the
goal of equality? If not, how can education become the
great equalizer?
Quality: Do education's content and delivery
support societies in achieving sustainable
development objectives? If not, how can education
help learners to not only acquire knowledge but also
be agents of change?
Efficiency: Does the current institutional arrangement
of teaching learners in classrooms support the
achievement of equity and quality? If not, how can
education balance individualized instruction and
socialization needs?

How best can digital technology be included in a
strategy to tackle these challenges, and under what
conditions? Digital technology packages and transmits
information on an unprecedented scale at a high speed
and low cost. Information storage has revolutionized the
volume of accessible knowledge. Information processing
enables learners to receive immediate feedback
and, through interaction with machines, adapt their
learning pace and trajectory: Learners can organize the
sequence of what they learn to suit their background
and characteristics. Information sharing lowers the
cost of interaction and communication. But while such
technology has tremendous potential, many tools have not
been designed for application to education. Not enough
attention has been paid to how they are applied in
education and even less to how they should be applied in
different education contexts.
On the question of equity and inclusion, ICT – and digital
technology in particular – helps lower the education access
cost for some disadvantaged groups: those who live in
remote areas, are displaced, face learning difficulties, lack
time or have missed out on past education opportunities.
But while access to digital technology has expanded
rapidly, there are deep divides in access. Disadvantaged
groups own fewer devices, are less connected to the
internet (Figure 1.1) and have fewer resources at home.
The cost of much technology is falling rapidly but is still

too high for some. Households that are better off can
buy technology earlier, giving them more advantages and
compounding disparity. Inequality in access to technology
exacerbates existing inequality in access to education,
a weakness exposed during the COVID-19 school closures.
Education quality is a multifaceted concept.
It encompasses adequate inputs (e.g. availability
of technology infrastructure), prepared teachers (e.g.
teacher standards for technology use in classrooms),
relevant content (e.g. integration of digital literacy in
the curriculum) and individual learning outcomes (e.g.
minimum levels of proficiency in reading and mathematics).
But education quality should also encompass social
outcomes. It is not enough for students to be vessels
receiving knowledge; they need to be able to use it to
help achieve sustainable development in social, economic
and environmental terms. This report’s stance is that
there is no more important contemporary challenge than
sustainability. Thus the definition of quality in an education
system should encompass the system’s ability to equip
learners to act in ways that help achieve sustainable
development in the social, economic and environmental
senses. Yet most education systems do not fare well with
respect to this challenge.

Views vary widely on the extent to which digital
technology can enhance education quality. Some argue
that, in principle, digital technology creates engaging
learning environments, enlivens student experiences,
simulates situations, facilitates collaboration and expands
connections. But others say digital technology tends to
support an individualized approach to education, reducing
learners’ opportunities to socialize and learn by observing
each other in real-life settings. Moreover, just as new
technology overcomes some constraints, it brings its own
problems. Increased screen time has been associated with
adverse effects on physical and mental health. Insufficient
regulation has led to unauthorized use of personal data for
commercial purposes. Digital technology has also helped
spread misinformation and hate speech, including through
education. Such challenges may cancel out any benefits.
Improvements to efficiency may be the most promising
way for digital technology to make a difference in
education. Technology is touted as being able to reduce the
time students and teachers spend on menial tasks, time
that can be used in other, educationally more meaningful,
activities. However, there are conflicting views on what
is meaningful. The way that education technology is used
is more complex than just a substitution of resources.

Technology may be one-to-many, one-to-one or
peer-to-peer. It may require students to learn alone or
with others, online or offline, independently or networked.
It delivers content, creates learner communities and
connects teachers with students. It provides access to
information. It may be used for formal or informal learning
and can assess what has been learned. It is used as a tool
for productivity, creativity, communication, collaboration,
design and data management. It may be professionally
produced or have user-generated content. It may be
specific to schools and place-based or transcend time
and place. As in any complex system, each technology
tool involves distinct infrastructure, design, content and
pedagogy, and each may promote different types
of learning.

HOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER
TECHNOLOGY WORKS IN EDUCATION?
In order to understand whether each form of technology
addresses equity, quality and efficiency of education, three
questions need to be answered. First, what is the logical
mechanism that leads from the use of a piece of hardware
or software to improved learning? Second, are the
conditions under which a technological tool is supposed
to work met in practice or is implementation failing? Third,
what evidence is collected, by whom, and how in order to
evaluate impact?
Technology is evolving too fast to permit evaluation
that could inform decisions on legislation, policy and
regulation. Research on technology in education is as
complex as technology itself. Studies evaluate experiences
of learners of various ages using various methodologies
applied in contexts as different as self-study, classrooms
and schools of diverse sizes and features, non-school
settings, and at system level. Findings that apply in some
contexts are not always replicable elsewhere. Some
conclusions can be drawn from long-term studies as
technologies mature, but there is an endless stream of
new products. Meanwhile, not all impact can be easily
measured, given technology’s ubiquity, complexity, utility
and heterogeneity. Good research needs to balance
quantitative and qualitative methods, look into evidence
of both positives and negatives, and avoid cutting corners
in its design, for instance with respect to focus outcomes
or fieldwork locations. In brief, while there is much general
research on education technology, the amount of research
into specific applications and contexts is insufficient,
making it difficult to prove that a particular technology
enhances a particular kind of learning.

C H A P T E R 1 • I ntroduction

Why is there often the perception that technology can
address major education challenges? To understand the
discourse around education technology, it is necessary
to look behind the language being used to promote it,
and the interests it serves. Who frames the problems
technology should address? What are the consequences
of such framing for education? Who promotes
education technology as a precondition for education
transformation? How credible are such claims? What
criteria and standards need to be set to evaluate digital
technology's current and potential future contribution
to education so as to separate hype from substance?
Can evaluation go beyond short-term assessments of
impact on learning and capture potential far-reaching
consequences of the generalized use of digital technology
in education?
Exaggerated claims about technology go hand in hand
with exaggerated estimates of its global market size.
In 2022, business intelligence providers’ estimates
ranged from USD 123 billion (Grand View Research, 2023)
to USD 300 billion (HolonIQ, 2022a). These accounts are
almost always projected forward, predicting optimistic
expansion, yet they fail to show historic trends and verify
whether past projections proved true. Such reporting
routinely characterizes education technology as essential
and technology companies as enablers and disruptors.
If optimistic projections are not fulfilled, responsibility is
implicitly placed on governments as a way of maintaining
indirect pressure on them to increase procurement
(Mármol Queraltó, 2021).
Education is ‘often decried for being slow to change,
for being stuck in the past’ (Weller, 2022, p. 33).
The perspective that education ‘lags the digital leaps’
(Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2022, p. 1), that the sector ‘lagged
behind’ the corporate sector in adopting technology (PwC,
2022, p. 10), and that education systems are ‘traditionally
laggards when it comes to innovation’ (OECD, 2021,
p. 3) is emphasized. In one such misleading presentation,
education was characterized as ‘grossly under digitized’
because ‘less than 4%’ of global education expenditure by
governments and households is allocated to technology
(HolonIQ, 2022b). But there is no basis for the suggestion
that education’s success should be measured by how much
spending is allocated to technology. Another presentation
estimating the value of global education technology
stated ‘it’s just the beginning’ as the ‘industry’s growth is
undeniable’ (Yelenevych, 2022). Such coverage plays on
users’ fascination with novelty but also their fear of being
left behind.

B OX 1.1:

Generative artificial intelligence is the latest technology touted as having the potential to transform
education
Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the application of computer science through algorithms to process large data sets to help solve
problems. As algorithms and processing methods become more sophisticated in the ways they classify information and make predictions,
they begin to imitate human brain functions more closely. Generative AI applies such sophisticated processing on vast data sets of natural
language, code language and images to create new content in these and other data forms.
AI of one sort or another has been applied in education for at least 40 years (Aleven and Koedinger, 2002). Multiple examples are
mentioned throughout this report, of which three stand out. First, intelligent tutoring systems track student progress, difficulties
and errors, going through structured subject content to provide feedback and adjust the level of difficulty to create an optimal
learning path. Second, AI can support writing assignments and, conversely, can be used to automatically assess writing assignments,
including identifying plagiarism and other forms of cheating. Third, AI has been applied to immersive learning experiences and games
(UNESCO, 2021).
Its creators expect generative AI to increase all these tools’ effectiveness to such an extent that their use could become widespread,
further personalizing learning and reducing the time teachers spend on tasks such as marking and lesson preparation (Google, 2022).
Commonly used intelligent tutoring systems, such as Duolingo Max, which supports foreign language learning, and Khanmigo, which is
used alongside Khan Academy video lessons, have collaborated with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, the best-known generative AI
tool, to increase their effectiveness. Increased data processing power may also generalize the collection and use of data to detect student
disengagement, including during examinations taken online. AI tools have been rapidly adopted. ChatGPT had more than 1 billion monthly
page visits by February 2023 (Carr, 2023). In 2022, a survey of US professionals found that 37% of those in advertising or marketing and
19% of those in teaching had used it in some way at work (Thormundsson, 2023).
The potential implications for education are numerous. If repetitive tasks are increasingly being automated and more jobs require
higher-order thinking skills, the pressure on education institutions to develop such skills will increase. If written assignments no longer
indicate mastery of certain skills, assessment methods will need to develop. If intelligent tutoring replaces at least some teaching tasks,
teacher preparation and practices will need to shift accordingly. While many technologies previously promoted as transformative did not
live up to expectations, the sheer growth in computing power behind generative AI raises the question whether this technology could be
the turning point.
Some countries have been responding to the implications of AI, although so far the focus has been on education’s role in supporting
capacity development in AI (World Bank, 2021). France has a strategy to develop AI research capacity, including through a talent
attraction and support programme (France Ministry of Higher Education and Research, 2018). India’s National Strategy for AI includes
education as one of five focus areas (Niti Aayog, 2018). But a review of 24 national AI strategies published between 2016 and 2020 found
that one third addressed integration of AI in teaching and learning (Schiff, 2022). In Singapore, the National AI Strategy and the EdTech
Plan (2020–30) highlight AI for personalizing teaching and learning through national learning platforms (Singapore Ministry of Education,
2022b; Singapore Smart Nation and Digital Government Office, 2019), which all school leaders, teachers and students have access to,
helping track student progress (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2022b). Another global survey found that 11 out of 51 governments had
developed and implemented AI curricula (UNESCO, 2022a).
Yet the spread of generative AI brings risks. It makes it harder for people to trust information. As lines between reality and invention
continue to be blurred, people become more susceptible to being deceived. As the content generated by AI improves, people may even
become too trusting (OpenAI, 2023). Pernicious algorithms with biased design pose further risks. In the United Kingdom, algorithms
applied to predict grades during the COVID-19 school closures, for instance, exacerbated inequality by socioeconomic background
(Kolkman, 2020). There are risks associated with human rights (e.g. use of surveillance techniques), democracy (e.g. algorithms
reproducing prejudices) and legislation (e.g. the possibility of making the use of AI compulsory in education) (Holmes et al., 2022).

B OX 1.1: C O N T I N U E D
Generative AI may not bring the kind of change in education often discussed. Whether and how AI would be used in education is an open
question (Gillani et al., 2023). The appeal of learning alone with chatbots may wear off quickly. Even if perfected, such tools may be
cumbersome and fail to result in any improvement. Personalization in education should vary learner paths to reach not the same learning
levels but different ones that fulfil individual potential (Holmes et al., 2018). More evidence is needed to understand whether AI tools can
change how students learn, beyond the superficial level of correcting mistakes. By simplifying the process of obtaining answers, such
tools could decrease student motivation to perform independent research and generate solutions (Kasneci et al., 2023). Their spread
could magnify risks mentioned throughout this report. For instance, if differences in student learning speeds are mismanaged, it could
widen achievement gaps (Cardona et al., 2023).
The advent of generative AI may not require major changes in education policy responses. For instance, it does not fundamentally change
the set of essential digital competencies that was defined before its emergence. Teacher professional development programmes may
need to be adapted somewhat to reflect new ways of assigning homework and assessing students. Supporting teachers in developing
better prompts to chatbots is one of several potential areas of development (Farrokhnia et al., 2023). But, overall, general teacher
proficiency remains crucial in making appropriate pedagogical choices while using this technology (Cooper, 2023).
There is a need to reflect on what it means to be well-educated in a world shaped by AI. Faced with new technology tools, the ideal
response is unlikely to be further specialization in technology-related domains; rather, it is a balanced curriculum that maintains if not
strengthens and improves the delivery of arts and humanities to reinforce learners’ responsibility, empathy, moral compass, creativity
and collaboration. The implication of intelligent tutoring systems cannot be that AI replaces teachers altogether but that teachers are
entrusted with more responsibility than ever to help societies navigate this critical moment. A consensus is forming about the need to
enjoy AI’s benefits while eliminating risks from its unchecked use, through regulation relating to ethics, responsibility and safety.

The switch to education technology during COVID-19 raised awareness of its limitations

An ed-tech tragedy?
Educational technologies and school
closures in the time of COVID-19

Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic led to educational technology being used
for learning out of school, at a pace and scale with no historical precedent. For
hundreds of millions of students, formal learning became heavily dependent on
technology, whether internet-connected digital devices, television or radio. A
forthcoming UNESCO publication, An Ed-Tech Tragedy? Educational Technologies and
School Closures in the Time of COVID-19, examines education during the pandemic
from early 2020 through the end of 2022. It documents how technology-based
solutions left a global majority of learners behind and how education was
diminished even when technology was available and worked as intended.

The report documents the ambition that marked the initial transition from schools
to education technology as the pandemic took hold. To better understand why
and how countries turned to technology as a stopgap measure to address school
closures, it examines the concept of technological solutionism – the belief that
every problem, or even things not previously identified as problems, has a solution
based in technology. The report traces the rise and dissemination of the idea that
internet-connected technology could, and even should, replace schools as the
primary means of formal education. Visions of technology-reliant and technologyguided education rest on assumptions that mainstream schooling models are
outdated and no longer fit a digital age of instant information. Technology,
its advocates argue, has possibilities for ubiquitous learning and would better facilitate the types of learning and skills development
demanded in a connected world awash in data and content.

The publication also looks behind the ambitions of a shift to technology-based solutions to document what was and was not delivered in
the challenging context of the pandemic. The COVID-19 school closures led to scrutiny of the ways technology can be used in education.
The forthcoming report shows that the core areas in which technology failed to live up to expectations are, unsurprisingly, the same areas
where it has failed to deliver in past decades, which this Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report) covers in depth. The shift to
digital learning left many students behind, exacerbating inequality. Even when connected technology was available, technology-centred
modes of learning tended to result in low student engagement and poor achievement. Looking beyond learning, the analysis in An Ed-Tech
Tragedy focuses on the many ways young people’s immersion in technology for education and other purposes has been unhealthy. Finally,
it points out that the centrality of education technology has empowered and enriched powerful private sector actors, enabled new and
invasive forms of surveillance and control, and ushered in often overlooked environmental consequences, among other harms.
Taking these risks into account, An Ed-Tech Tragedy? questions whether school closures and the shift to remote learning protected public
health and saved lives. Did remote learning alternatives to education contribute to the prolongation of school closures? Were there
alternatives to connected technology when schools were shuttered? Was COVID-19 an education crisis in addition to a health crisis? The
publication challenges the assertion that education technology investment necessarily strengthens education system resilience, and
hence it also questions the assertion that expenditure on education technology should necessarily be scaled up.
Echoing the findings of the 2023 GEM Report, the publication concludes that the COVID-19 education experience serves as a reminder
that digital transformation should not entail replacing the deeply human enterprise of teaching and learning. It repeats the GEM Report’s
calls for technology design, regulation and use that put all learners back at the centre, strengthen the right to education for all, and better
serve the needs and interests of those closest to education. The publication calls for continued dialogue to draw knowledge from the
education technology experiences of the pandemic, making sure the integration of technology in education better aligns with the sector’s
humanistic aims and better ensures the progress and well-being of school leaders, teachers, students, parents and societies.

WHAT DO COUNTRIES FOCUS ON
WHEN THEY INVEST IN EDUCATION
TECHNOLOGY?
At the same time that the role of technology in education
is being debated, every country in the world has invested
in the use of digital technology in education to some
extent. A review of one country from each SDG region
opens a window into how they have understood the role
of technology in their education system, how technology
has been applied, who is involved and what challenges
have been encountered. Each case study links to content
covered in various chapters of the GEM Report. Their
wide variation shows that the policymakers’ perspective
on education technology issues is often distant from the
questions raised in this introduction. On the whole, it can
be said that, while countries invest in digital technology for
education, business rather than education arguments are
more commonly deployed to justify these investments.

With some notable exceptions, countries often appear to
pay little attention to whether their investment has been
relevant and had an impact on learning, whether it has
been equitable and inclusive, whether it is economically
efficient, and whether it has longer-term negative effects
on human rights and well-being. Questions are hanging
over the type and quality of evidence used in making
decisions. Countries tend to describe progress in terms
of the technology inputs they have purchased instead of
the learning improvement these inputs have achieved.
While in some cases, education technology investment
is aligned and integrated with related investment in the
rest of government, in other cases such investment
does not respond to an education system’s specific
problems. Instead, it appears more as a modern accessory,
something that is added to the education system, possibly
to imitate other education systems or in a belief that
technology is a good in itself.

There is no basis for the suggestion that education’s success should be
measured by how much spending is allocated to technology

B OX 1.3:

Egypt
Egypt introduced technology in education in the 1990s, initially with support from international actors that saw it as key to the problem
of rote learning (Warschauer, 2003; 2004). In 2006, the Egyptian Education Initiative, a partnership between the government, the
World Economic Forum and the private sector, tried to introduce coherence across multiple externally supported activities, related for
instance to broadband and smart schools. By 2011, 70,000 computers had been deployed, 185,000 people had been trained and more
than 2,000 schools had been involved. However, an evaluation of the partnership, which included companies such as Cisco, Intel and
Microsoft, found that it had not focused sufficiently on education outcomes, had underestimated the complexity of education, and had
not monitored and evaluated implementation (World Economic Forum, 2012).
In the second half of the 2010s, after having heavily prioritized the digitization of its public sector (Egypt Ministry of Communications
and Information Technology, 2020), Egypt launched Education 2.0 in 2017, a major education reform placing digital technology at the
heart of efforts to support skills-based learning (Kazem, 2020). The private sector has been actively involved in infrastructure, curriculum
development and platforms (Oxford Business Group, 2022).
Plans to equip schools with multimedia laboratories and digital devices were not new, but their implementation was slow
(Ewiss et al., 2019). In 2019, the education technology company Promethean World was commissioned to digitize 26,000 classrooms
through interactive displays (Oxford Business Group, 2020; Promethean, 2019). Its parent company, NetDragon Websoft Holdings,
specialized in gaming and mobile applications, was recruited to build more than 3,000 smart modular classrooms and address the
problem of overcrowded spaces (Oxford Business Group, 2022). Tablets were provided to 25,000 public schools (Egypt Today, 2020).
Private companies have been engaged heavily in adapting the curriculum to ICT. Discovery Education, a consultancy specialized in digital
curriculum, has been consulted for school programme design (Moustafa et al., 2022). National Geographic Learning, a firm specialized in
English-language learning resources, has provided curriculum content and delivered print and digital materials to grades 4 to 6 (Cengage
Group, 2021). The school curriculum has been updated to integrate digital learning resources, including personal devices, in-class
coaching and computer-based assessments. New education programmes focus on a competency-based and multidisciplinary approach
(Moustafa et al., 2022; Saavedra, 2019).
Digital learning resources have become progressively more available (Welsh, 2020). Launched in 2016, the Egyptian Knowledge Bank
provides free teaching materials aligned with the reformed education programmes. Initially providing research sources to secondary
and higher education, the platform was significantly expanded in the aftermath of school closures during COVID-19. It quickly became
the region’s largest digital learning platform, with over 20 million daily views (El Zayat, 2022; UN Transforming Education Summit,
2022; UNESCO, 2022b). Related resources included learning management systems and platforms in primary and secondary education;
online lessons, some for free on YouTube, some for a fee; and the now defunct Edmodo platform (UNICEF, 2021c). These efforts were
documented in the Education 2.0 Research & Documentation Project at the Social Research Center of the American University of
Cairo (RDP, 2021).
Education technology’s impact in terms of both learning outcomes and equity has not yet been evaluated in Egypt (Helmy et al., 2020;
Moustafa et al., 2022). Some questioned the reform’s fit with the social and cultural context (Ramzy, 2021). A study of secondary school
teachers suggested that they did not regard education technology as a top priority for education reform, even if they recognized its
potential benefits (Badran et al., 2021). Monitoring was limited to access (e.g. to the Egyptian Knowledge Bank) rather than actual use
(Sobhy, 2023). Three in five children reported accessing digital platforms during COVID-19 (UNICEF, 2021a).

Estonia
Estonia made digitization across government a national priority when it became independent 30 years ago. Not only education but also
taxation, voting and healthcare were progressively digitized. In 2002, each citizen was equipped with a digital identity for access to public
services. Providing citizens with digital skills quickly became a necessity (Kattel and Mergel, 2019). Digital technology’s integration in
education began in 1996 with the Tiger Leap Initiative (Tiigrihüpe) developing school ICT infrastructure. By 2001, every classroom had
access to a computer and all schools went online. Teachers and school leaders were progressively trained in the use of digital technology
and its integration in teaching practices (Aru-Chabilan, 2020). School management was digitized in the 2000s and communication portals,
including eKool and Stuudium, were introduced. Since 2015, textbooks and learning materials have been available via a cloud repository,
the e-Schoolbag (e-koolikot) (OECD, 2020d), which consists mostly of open educational resources (Põldoja, 2020).
However, attitudes and beliefs about education technology effectiveness and benefits have not evolved as rapidly as technology itself
(Haaristo et al., 2019). Some teachers have resisted the integration of digital tools (Leppik et al., 2017). Estonia was ranked first among
EU countries in a readiness index for ‘digital lifelong learning’, but a few teachers still preferred traditional approaches (Beblavý et al.,
2019). In the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey, only one in three lower secondary school teachers reported feeling
adequately prepared to use ICT in teaching (European Commission, 2020). On the other hand, 75% had received ICT training as part of
their professional development, compared with an average of 60% in OECD countries overall (OECD, 2020b). A survey of teachers found
they had limited knowledge about artificial intelligence and how it could support them (Chounta et al., 2023).
From 2012, the ProgeTiger programme enhanced digital literacy in the curriculum (Aru-Chabilan, 2020). Digital competencies have been
taught and tested using the European Union DigComp framework (Estonian Education and Youth Board, 2021; Mehisto and Kitsing,
2021). Yet teaching has been uneven between schools. A Tallinn University study reported that informatics was taught in less than
half of schools, mostly because of shortages of qualified teachers (Põldoja, 2020). The Estonian Lifelong Learning Strategy 2020 and
its successor, the strategic plan Education 2035, have focused on adult digital skills. By 2016, 10% of the country’s adults had received
computer training (Estonian Education and Youth Board, 2020). In 2019, 65% of the population had at least basic digital skills (European
Commission, 2020). Vali-IT (Choose IT) is a short, intensive professional development course. ICT skills acquired outside formal education
are formally recognized (e-Estonia, 2021; European Commission, 2020). The share of students enrolled in tertiary ICT programmes has
consistently increased over time, reaching 12% in 2020, twice the OECD rate (OECD, 2020a; Viik, 2020).
Launched in 2005, the web-based Estonian Education Information System collects information on individual learning trajectories.
Accessible through an individual identification number, the system tracks student personal information, including on performance and
special needs, from early childhood to adulthood. Teachers are required to input data through the school management system. The
interoperability platform X-Road connects the database to other national electronic registers, facilitating data exchange (OECD, 2020d).
The identity-based data system was possible because of the transparency and integrity of the ICT infrastructure (Kattel and Mergel,
2019; OECD, 2020d). The Data Protection Inspectorate has clear guidelines on data use (Ruiz-Calleja et al., 2017).
Estonia’s education system is considered one of the world’s most digitized, a model for digital learning (Estonian Education and Youth
Board, 2020). Over the years, Estonian schools have taken part in several projects and been supported by public agencies, universities and
technology companies. Yet school staff believe the emphasis has been on monitoring the number of devices and the speed of connectivity
instead of evaluating learning impact (Lorenz et al., 2016).

Nepal
In Nepal, numerous strategy and policy documents have committed to strengthening ICT in education, including the 2010 and 2015 ICT
policies and the 2019 Digital Nepal Framework. The framework proposed a series of ambitious initiatives, including smart classrooms,
rural mobile learning centres, a rent-a-laptop programme, a biometric student and teacher attendance monitoring system, an online
education management information system, and a centralized university admission system (Nepal Ministry of Communication and
Information Technology, 2019). As part of the framework, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority contracted ICT laboratories in
930 community schools (Fiscal Nepal, 2020) and two years later the government announced that laboratories would be set up in
2,300 community schools by 2025 (Onlinekhabar, 2022).
Under the education ministry, four plans – the School Sector Reform Plan 2009–2015, the ICT in Education Master Plan 2013–2017,
the School Sector Development Plan 2016–2023 and the School Education Sector Plan 2022/23–2031/32 – proposed ICTrelated interventions. The 2016–2023 plan focused on ICT facilities in model schools (ADB, 2022). Reviewing the situation, the
2022/23–2031/32 plan reported that, among 28,000 community schools, 61% had electricity, 42% had computer facilities and 22% had
internet connection but, critically, ‘very few schools use them for teaching and learning’ (Center for Education and Human Resource
Development, 2022; Nepal Ministry of Education, 2022).
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology provided funds for one teacher to be trained from each school where an ICT laboratory
had been set up. Schools had to find a training institute, but received no guidance on the content of the training required (ADB, 2017).
Opportunities for teacher education in ICT are extremely limited (Rana and Rana, 2020). A study estimated that only 12% of public schools
used ICT in teaching and learning in 2019/20, and just 1% of public school teachers reported being able to integrate it in their practice
(Rubin, 2021).
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Curriculum Development Centre developed digital resources for grade 6 to 8 mathematics,
science and English. These and other resources were uploaded in 2020 to a new learning platform, Sikai Chautari (Bhatta and Gyawali,
2021; Centre for Education and Human Resources Development, 2023). But the resources were not easily accessible. A survey of
7,500 households during the pandemic found that 29% of children were offered distance learning opportunities but only 12% used
them (UNICEF, 2020). Less than 5% of students used a dedicated YouTube channel and Sikai Chautari during school closures (Centre for
Education and Human Resource Development, 2022). In higher education, the potential of blended courses provided by the new Nepal
Open University remains untapped (Dhakal and Bhandari, 2019; Khanal et al., 2021).
Open Learning Exchange Nepal, a non-governmental organization, has played an active role in supporting government efforts over the
past 15 years (Karki, 2019). It has mainly focused on infrastructure. It distributed laptops (like those offered by the One Laptop Per
Child programme), school networks (consisting of a server and a Wi-Fi router) and solar power installations. E-Paath is a collection of
curriculum-based, subject-specific digital interactive learning activities in Nepali and English for grades 1 to 8, as well as in Nepali Sign
Language for grades 1 to 6. E-Pustakalaya is an e-library that has made more than 12,800 textbooks and video materials available for
free (OLE Nepal, 2023). Some 1,200 schools benefited from these digital resources through offline servers during the pandemic
(Joshi et al., 2022).

Rwanda
Rwanda started its multiyear national information and communications infrastructure plans in the late 1990s (Rwanda Government,
2015; World Bank, 2022). They have progressively helped digitize public services, including for paying taxes and consulting judicial
proceedings and health data (Davidson et al., 2019; Rwanda Ministry of ICT and Innovation, 2019). The education system has also
embraced digital transformation, with key plans drafted in the mid-2010s: the SMART Rwanda 2020 Master Plan and the 2016 ICT in
Education Policy (Rwanda Ministry of Education, 2016; Wallet and Kimenyi, 2019); the latter is currently under review (Buningwire, 2022).
Rwanda started implementing the One Laptop Per Child programme in 2008 in selected primary schools; it is estimated that
275,000 laptops had been distributed by 2020 (IGIHE, 2020). However, these laptops were no longer useful, as a contract to update
digital learning materials on them was incompatible with the competence-based curriculum that had come into effect in the meantime
(Rwanda Office of the Auditor General, 2020). A plan to replace some of the more expensive XO computers of the One Laptop Per
Child programme with locally produced devices ran into problems: ICT company Positivo BGH was commissioned in 2014 to provide
150,000 computers annually but the government reduced the target to 40,000 units in 2017 due to lack of funding. The agreement was
not renewed in 2020 (Iliza, 2022). The government aims to provide every teacher with a laptop; one in eight teachers had been reached by
2021 (Ndayambaje, 2023).
Several projects have focused on improving school computer facilities. The Smart Classroom programme was launched in 2016. The
Rwanda Education Board specified there should be sufficient space for 50 computers and a smart screen projector for video conferencing
in each smart classroom, at a cost of about USD 45,000 each (Rwanda Ministry of Education, 2016; Sabiiti, 2019). Despite the high cost,
and a massive conventional classroom construction effort taking place in parallel, significant progress was made. In 2020/21, 10% of
primary and 45% of secondary schools had smart classroom settings (Rwanda Ministry of Education, 2022); the target for secondary was
88% by 2024 (Nsanzimana, 2022). Progress in rural areas may be impeded by the fact that 45% of schools in rural areas are not connected
to the electricity grid (UNICEF, 2021b).
Rwanda is one of the few African countries to provide wide 4G coverage. In total, 32% of primary schools, 53% of secondary schools,
58% of technical and vocational institutes, and all universities are connected to the internet (Rwanda Ministry of Education, 2022). Some
46% of secondary school students can get online in dedicated computer laboratories (Mugiraneza, 2021). But among schools without
internet, 22% lack access because of the cost (UNICEF, 2021b).
The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the College of Education collaborated to develop curriculum-aligned content (World
Bank, 2022), fulfilling the aim of the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2018/19 to 2023/24 to develop digital content and integrate ICT in
teaching and learning (Rwanda Ministry of Education, 2018). Digital textbooks are available through the open-access platform Shupavu,
managed by the Rwanda Education Board. Learners also used Shupavu for access to educational resources during the COVID-19 school
closures via YouTube and radio and TV programmes (Pankin, 2021). Of the 17 education technology companies active in Rwanda,
10 began their operations in 2020, mostly focusing on content (Laterite, 2023). A review of technology use in science and mathematics
teaching in Rwandan classrooms, from simulations to videos and smart classrooms, found that it had improved teacher practices and
some student abilities, but that lack of teacher confidence, pedagogical skills and internet access were limiting progress
(Adegoke et al., 2023).
A child online protection policy was approved in 2019 (Davidson et al., 2019; World Bank, 2019) and a personal data and privacy
protection law adopted in 2021 (Rwanda Government, 2021). The use of personal mobile phones is banned in classrooms (Niyonzima,
2018). The National Cyber Security Authority guides parents and guardians on how to manage children’s online access and has issued a
recommendation on screen time (Rwanda National Cyber Security Authority, 2022).

Samoa
Education in Samoa has been repeatedly disrupted by emergencies, as has often been the case in other Pacific Island states. In 2019,
schools were closed for a long period due to a severe measles outbreak that forced Samoa to prepare for potential school closures, which
occurred shortly thereafter with the COVID-19 pandemic (Iosefa, 2020).
Internet connectivity is not straightforward in Samoa. The installation of undersea fibre cables in 2018 and 2019 expanded internet use
in the country (Mayron, 2019). Deregulation initially brought costs down (Samoa Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour, 2022). But
dissatisfaction with speed, reliability and affordability, including with the services connecting schools, led the government to buy back
ownership of the cable (Pacific Island Times, 2022). Satellite-based internet has also been considered to overcome persistent Wi-Fi dead
spots (Membrere, 2021), despite its higher cost (Sanerivi, 2022).
Just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, only 40% of primary and 57% of secondary schools had access to a reliable internet connection
(Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2019a). Efforts to improve internet access for learning during the COVID-19 emergency
had limited results. Mobile broadband was enhanced through agreements with the mobile service providers Digicel and Vodafone. With
UNESCO support, Vodafone committed to providing free SIM cards to students for access to learning websites, along with a set amount
of free data usage, and to developing and hosting a free student e-learning portal, aligned with school curricula (Fruean, 2020; UNESCO,
2020). However, the SIM cards did not reach all learners (UIS, 2020b). After almost one year, less than one third of them had been
distributed. Moreover, slow internet speed interfered with uploading learning material and accessibility of audios, videos and Moodle
online (Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2020).
School ICT infrastructure has been strengthened in Samoa in the past 20 years (Chan Mow, 2008). Primary schools are connected through
the PrimaryNet project (Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2019a). In 2016, the Asian Development Bank supported the
SchoolNet project to also equip secondary schools with digital devices and train teachers and local communities in all districts (ADB,
2019). Results included a bank of over 28,000 digital science resources, stronger teacher capacity to use these resources for instruction,
development of 120 model learning activities linking the resources with the curriculum and learning standards, and 38 school-based
learning centres with access to the resources offline. While the original intention was to use open education resources, the rights to an
existing international platform were bought instead to benefit from consistent user interface, design and terminology (Strigel, 2020).
Despite challenges, online distance and flexible blended learning have been embedded into education planning (Samoa Ministry of
Education, Sports and Culture, 2019b). Moodle was identified as the most suitable learning platform across the education system,
drawing on the experience of tertiary institutions (Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2020; Samoa Observer, 2022).
The National University of Samoa and the University of the South Pacific provided courses through this open-source learning platform
to respond promptly to campus closures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of the South Pacific made more than
250 face-to-face courses accessible via Moodle SMS. Its Centre for Flexible Learning provided technical support to both
professionals and students (University of the South Pacific, 2020).
With only one third of Samoans estimated to use the internet on a regular basis, radio and television were identified as the main channels
to reach students. Pre-recorded clips were broadcast via the national radio station for pre-primary and primary school students. Videos
were made available via the national television channels for all learners. However, plans to rely on alternative television and radio
channels were not implemented or were stopped because of lack of capacity (Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2020). As
9 in 10 households own a cell phone compared with 1 in 10 owning a computer, online educational resources were also made available
for free through mobile broadband on the ministry’s website (Samoa Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, 2020).

Singapore
Singapore has one of the world’s most digitally competitive economies (IMD, 2022), with a socioeconomic development model founded
on innovation in education and training (Kwek et al., 2020; NCEE, 2021). Since 1997, it has launched four master plans on ICT in
education, which laid the foundations for developing school ICT infrastructure, enhancing digital solutions, integrating ICT in curriculum
and assessment, and raising technology awareness (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2022a). The ICT infrastructure was given a boost by
the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which forced education to move fully online (Watermeyer et al., 2022).
Introduced in 2017, the digital portal Student Learning Space (SLS) facilitates access to curriculum-aligned teaching and learning
materials, administration of learning assessments, and monitoring of student progress (NCEE, 2021; Singapore Ministry of Education,
2022b). The 2019 Education Technology Plan promoted personalized and self-directed learning based on digital technology (Singapore
Ministry of Education, 2022b). Adaptive learning systems facilitate personalization of learning in mathematics and English; in the latter
case, an ‘assistant’ provides personalized feedback on writing. A dashboard feature in SLS helps teachers monitor student performance
and plan lessons, while the SLS Community Gallery encourages teachers to share lessons with peers, including through the Singapore
Learning Designers Community, which counts 20,000 teachers as members, encouraging exchange of ideas and troubleshooting
(Singapore Ministry of Education, 2022c).
Just before the outbreak of COVID-19, more than two in five learners from lower-income households did not have a computer.
Among those who had one, almost half shared it with other family members (Yeung, 2020). A study on information literacy showed
that children and youth without internet access at home tended to be less proficient in selecting and synthesizing information
(Majid et al., 2020). Some 12,500 devices were loaned out to ensure all students were connected during the school closure (Min, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic led to the institutionalization of home-based learning (Watermeyer et al., 2022). Since 2021, lower and upper
secondary school students have been able to choose to study remotely two days a month. The practice has also been piloted in selected
primary schools (NCEE, 2021). As a result, all 144,000 secondary students were to be provided with a personal learning device to study
from home on a regular basis (Kai, 2020; Singapore Ministry of Education, 2021a), bringing the target date to the end of 2021 instead of
2028 as originally planned (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2022c).
Primary students learn computational thinking and simple coding through the Code for Fun programme. Secondary students can expand
computational thinking skills through the mathematics curriculum and develop an understanding of emerging technology, including
artificial intelligence (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2020a, 2020b). The latest curriculum review gave more space to socioemotional
competencies, taking into account the increased exposure to digital spaces. Starting in 2022, the time allocated to cyber wellness was
doubled to four hours a week (Teng, 2020). In the character and citizenship education class, primary and secondary students learn how to
identify mental health symptoms and distress caused by exposure to digital spaces, overuse of social media and access to inappropriate
content. They are taught to assess coping mechanisms and support services, and are encouraged to promote a peer-support structure to
better help each other (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2020b, 2021b). Students are directed to take responsibility for their online wellbeing and parents are advised to make screen time predictable, especially during home-based learning (Singapore Ministry of Education,
2018; 2021c).
In higher education, the campusX initiative of the Singapore University of Technology and Design experiments with sensor networks in
classrooms to gather data from eye trackers and wearables to provide live feedback to teachers and students through games, robots and
chatbots. In another experimental programme involving first-year students, video and voice analytics were used to analyse engagement,
while virtual reality and data analytics were used to encourage and monitor engagement with peers attending the programme from China
(Singapore Ministry of Education, 2022c).

Uruguay
Uruguay began restructuring its public sector after a financial crisis in the early 2000s. Digital technology was identified as a key driver of
national economic development. Education modernization was a core reform in the second half of the decade (Zucchetti et al., 2020). Plan
Ceibal, the national digital education plan, was launched in 2006, with high-level political support for coupling technological innovation
with social justice (Hinostroza et al., 2011; Larrouqué, 2017).
In 2007–09, Uruguay became the first country to implement the One Laptop Per Child programme nationwide and also connected
all schools to the internet. Two thirds of 6- to 13-year-olds from the poorest households had a computer exclusively through the
programme (Ceibal, 2022; Plan Ceibal, 2017). Students have since progressively received better tablets and advanced digital devices (Plan
Ceibal, 2017). Unlike most countries, Uruguay evaluated the impact of this investment in devices, which was found to not have improved
learning in reading and mathematics (de Melo et al., 2017). Another study found that the programme increased neither education
attainment nor the share of science and technology students in higher education (Yanguas, 2020).
In response to these findings, Plan Ceibal shifted its emphasis (Plan Ceibal, 2020; Severin, 2016) from inputs to pedagogy (Mateu et al.,
2018). In 2010–12, it turned its attention to computer use, notably through its Crea platform and teacher support. In 2013–19, the focus
shifted to transforming teaching practice through initiatives focusing on interdisciplinary projects and cross-cutting competencies, such
as global citizenship. Since 2020, Plan Ceibal has further emphasized communication with teachers and coordination with the national
education system while investing in infrastructure to support blended learning (Plan Ceibal, 2021). Software was made available through
Crea to solve the problem of videoconferencing consuming one gigabyte per hour when mobile plans offered only three gigabytes per
month; this was a key part of the response during the COVID-19 pandemic (Milder, 2022). The initiative Ceibal en casa, reached 85% of
primary and 90% of secondary school students, with poorer students’ internet data usage being free of charge (Ripani, 2022).
The Plan Ceibal infrastructure has also been used to address the shortage of qualified teachers in two subjects. First, Ceibal en Ingles was
introduced in 2012 in response to the introduction of English as a compulsory primary school subject in 2008 (Canale, 2019). Blended
remote teaching, whereby expert teachers collaborated, alternated with and mentored in-classroom teachers via videoconferencing and
a learning platform, was the programme’s core feature (Banegas, 2013). Practice was supported by digital tools, such as games, and
standard resources, informed by feedback and improved by teacher training that focused on overcoming the diversity of language abilities
in classrooms (Stanley, 2019). Participating students obtained similar results as children in the face-to-face programme (Banegas and
Brovetto, 2020).
Second, in 2017, computational thinking was introduced in grades 4 to 6 (Fowler and Vegas, 2021), reaching some 50,000 students,
mostly in urban areas (ANEP and Ceibal, 2022). The programme is provided by remote instructors and facilitated by in-class teachers
(Fowler and Vegas, 2021; Zucchetti et al., 2020). It was also piloted through extracurricular projects in secondary education. But results
from the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study showed that grade 8 students performed below participating
countries’ average (Fraillon et al., 2019). While 56% of students from the richest quintile of the population could perform simple
ICT-related activities, only 11% from the poorest quintile could do so (Ceibal and INEEd, 2022), the highest gap among
participating countries.
Originally placed outside government structures (Larrouqué, 2013), Plan Ceibal was relocated under the Presidency in 2010 and
ultimately under the Ministry of Education and Culture following the 2020 Law of Urgent Consideration. This institutional change is seen
as a long-overdue rationalization (Uruguay Parliament, 2020), although some believe it increases exposure to private sector influence
(Bordoli and Conte, 2020; Education International, 2021), a recurring theme in technology in education debates. It was rebranded as
Ceibal in 2022. Fundación Ceibal, established in 2014, conducts research to guide Ceibal but also to influence the region, through the
Alliance for the Digitalization of Education in Latin America (ADELA, 2022; Ripani, 2022).
Ceibal has used platforms not to reproduce traditional modes of education but to innovate in the curriculum (Reich and Ito, 2017; Rivas,
2023; Ruiz-Calleja et al., 2017). Analysis of the 2020 Aristas national assessment found that, after controlling for socioeconomic status,
the use of Ceibal platforms, such as Crea, was associated with better learning outcomes (Reimers et al., 2022; UIS, 2020a). It has been
notable for its emphasis on serving the most marginalized first. However, it has not resolved education challenges in the country. The
upper secondary completion rate increased from 35% in 2000 to just 42% in 2020, compared with 63% in Latin America and the Caribbean
and 88% in other high-income countries. Only 21% of the poorest quintile of youth, and as little as 13% among the poorest boys, finish
upper secondary school.

GUIDE TO THE REPORT
The thematic part of the report is split into three sections.
Chapters 2-6 identify major education challenges, asking
whether and how technology can help overcome them.
Chapter 2 focuses on equitable and inclusive access to
education for disadvantaged groups – populations living
in remote areas, affected by displacement or emergency,
with a disability or constrained by time – through
technology, including radio, television, mobile phones and
online learning. The COVID-19 pandemic was a natural
experiment that tested the capacity of distance education,
especially among the disadvantaged populations for whom
technology is meant to provide a solution.
Chapter 3 looks at equitable and inclusive access to
content and resources – and the question of how
knowledge can reach more learners in appealing and
cheaper formats. The open education movement
has emerged in response to the cost of content and
commercialization of previously free content and
platforms. Resources can be remixed, redistributed,
repurposed, translated and localized. Yet despite the
advantages of open resources, there are obstacles to
large-scale adoption.
Chapter 4 examines how technology can improve quality
in teaching and learning basic skills by offering two broad
types of opportunities. First, it can improve instruction
by addressing quality gaps, increasing available time and
opportunities to practise, and personalizing instruction.
Second, it can engage learners by varying how content
is represented, stimulating interaction and prompting
collaboration. However, technology can also be a source of
challenges in classrooms.
Chapter 5 focuses on how technology can improve quality
in delivering digital skills, which form part of a new set of
basic skills, at least in richer countries: information and
data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital
content creation, safety, and problem-solving. It is a major
challenge for education systems to manage new and
continuously evolving objectives related to technology,
especially when many learners acquire these skills outside
school settings.
Chapter 6 reviews technology’s contribution to making
education management more efficient and effective.
Education systems continually require more data, which
technology can help handle. Yet, education management
information systems struggle with their capacity to
integrate and analyse data, preventing their use for better
education management. Computer-based assessments

and computer adaptive testing also provide new
opportunities, which are still not fully exploited.
After the first section has explored the potential of
education technology to address major education
challenges, Chapters 7-9 ask what conditions will ensure
that this potential is fulfilled.
Chapter 7 asks how education systems can ensure that all
learners have access to technology resources. It reviews
access to electricity, hardware, software and the internet.
It also explores the types of evidence that underpin
government decisions on where to invest and the extent
to which procurement decisions take economic, social and
environmental sustainability into account.
Chapter 8 addresses how education systems can protect
learners from the adverse consequences of technology
use. Learners face risks related to content, contact and
conduct, which spill over to education. Legislation and
policies are being developed to promote standards,
regulation and legal protection for privacy, security
and safety, which is challenging in a context where the
governance of education technology is fragmented.
Chapter 9 deals with the question of how education
systems can support all teachers in using and dealing
with technology effectively in their practice. Teachers face
major and increasing demands to engage with technology
in education and develop related competencies. Barriers
to teachers’ technology use relate to their access to
technology, their beliefs about pedagogy and technology,
and the support they receive from schools and education
systems. At the same time, technology can be used to
transform teacher training and teachers' opportunities to
interact with peers.
Finally, Chapter 10 addresses a subject that merits
further exploration: Rather than only looking at the impact
of technology on education, as the bulk of the report
does, it looks at the impact of education on technology.
Education is the foundation of technological development.
As the science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) umbrella term suggests, education systems play a
major role in the transfer, absorption and development of
technology in every country. The chapter reviews selected
issues, such as the inclusion of technology as a subject
in curricula, policies to promote STEM education and the
evolving role of higher education as a pillar of national
technological development.
The monitoring part of the report consists of
Chapters 11-22. A short introductory chapter reviews
recent developments in SDG 4 progress monitoring,

including the national SDG 4 benchmarking process.
The next 10 chapters provide updates on progress towards
each of the SDG 4 targets, in a few cases reflecting on
the interrelationship between education and technology.
For example, Chapter 19 considers the application
of construction, energy and transport technology in
education. Each chapter pays particular attention to a
midterm review, even though COVID-19 has disrupted
education development and critical data are yet to
emerge that could help assess this medium-term impact.
The last chapter is dedicated to the evolution of education
financing.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Digital technology is becoming ubiquitous in people’s
daily lives. It is reaching the world’s most distant
corners. It is even creating new worlds, where the lines
between the real and the imaginary are harder to discern.
Education cannot remain unaffected, although there
are calls to protect it from the negative influences of
digital technology. However, this is a major challenge,
as technology appears in multiple forms in education. It is
an input, a means of delivery, a skill and a planning tool,
and provides a social and cultural context, all of which raise
particular questions and issues.








23

It is an input: Ensuring the provision, operation and
maintenance of technology infrastructure in education,
such as electricity, computers and internet connectivity,
at school or at home, requires considerable capital
investment, recurrent expenditure and procurement
skills. There is remarkably little reliable and consistent
information on these costs.
It is a means of delivery: Teaching and learning can
benefit from education technology. But the fast pace
of technological change and control of evidence by
technology providers makes it difficult to know which
technologies work best, in what context and under what
conditions.
It is a skill: Education systems are being called upon to
support learners at various levels in acquiring digital and
other technology skills, raising questions on content,
the best sequence of relevant courses, appropriate
education levels and provider modalities.
It is a planning tool: Governments are encouraged to
use technology tools to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of education system management, for
instance in collecting information on student behaviour
and outcomes.

It provides a social and cultural context: Technology
affects all spheres of life, expanding opportunities for
connection and access to information but also posing
risks to safety, privacy, equality and social cohesion,
sometimes resulting in harm from which users need
protection.

This report’s basic premise is that technology should
serve people and that technology in education should
put learners and teachers at the centre. The report tries
to avoid an overly technology-centred view or the claim
that technology is neutral. It also offers a reminder that,
as much technology was not designed for education,
its suitability and value need to be proven in relation to a
human-centred vision of education. Decision makers are
faced with four challenging trade-offs:

Technology in education should put learners
and teachers at the centre







The call for personalization and adaptation clashes with
the need to maintain the social dimension of education.
Those urging increased individualization may be missing
the point of what education is about. Technology
must be designed to respect the needs of a diverse
population. An assistive teaching and learning tool for
some may be a burden and distraction for others.
There is a trade-off between inclusivity and exclusivity.
Technology can potentially offer an education lifeline
to many. However, for many more it raises a further
barrier to equal education opportunities, with new
forms of digital exclusion emerging. It is not sufficient to
acknowledge that every technology has early adopters
and late followers; action is also needed. The principle of
equity in education and learning must be adhered to.
The commercial sphere and the commons pull in
different directions. The growing influence of the
education technology industry on education policy
at the national and international levels is a cause for
concern. A vivid example is how the promise of open
education resources and of the internet as a gateway to
education content is frequently compromised. A better
understanding and exposure of the interests underlying
the use of digital technology in education and learning
are needed so as to ensure that the common good is the
priority of governments and educators.

1



It is generally assumed that whatever efficiency
advantage education technology offers in the short
term will continue in the long term. Technology is
presented as a sound, potentially labour-saving
investment that may even be able to replace teachers.
However, its full economic and environmental costs
are usually underestimated and unsustainable. The
bandwidth and capacity of many to use technology
in education are limited. And it is time to reckon with
education technology’s cost in terms of environmental
sustainability and question whether such technology
truly strengthens education systems’ resilience.

to supporting progress towards SDG 4 to ensure that
efforts to promote technology, including artificial
intelligence, take into account the need to address the
main education challenges and to respect human rights.
In considering the adoption of digital technology, education
systems should always ensure that learners’ best interests
are placed at the centre of a framework based on rights.
The focus should be on learning outcomes, not digital
inputs. To help improve learning, digital technology
should not replace but instead complement face-to-face
interaction with teachers.

Even more recently, a clash between machines and
humans has surfaced in the context of debates over
generative artificial intelligence, whose implications for
education are only gradually emerging. These fault lines
leave the education sector torn between hope for digital
technologies’ potential and the undeniable risks and harms
linked to their application. ‘It is at the level of trade-offs
that a more complex and democratic debate ought to take
place’ (Morozov, 2022).
Not all change constitutes progress. Just because
something can be done does not mean it should be
done. Change needs to happen on learners’ terms to
avoid repeating a scenario like the one observed during
the COVID-19 pandemic, when an explosion of distance
learning left hundreds of millions behind.
Technology created for other uses cannot necessarily be
expected to be appropriate in all education settings for
all learners. Nor can regulations drawn up outside the
education sector necessarily be expected to cover all of
education’s needs. What this report calls for in this debate
is a clear vision – as the world considers what is best
for children’s learning, especially in the case of the most
marginalized.
The #TechOnOurTerms campaign calls for decisions
about technology in education to prioritize learner needs
after an assessment of whether its application would be
appropriate, equitable, evidence-based and sustainable.
It is essential to learn to live both with and without digital
technology; to take what is needed from an abundance
of information but ignore what is not necessary; to let
technology support, but never supplant, the human
connection on which teaching and learning are based.
Accordingly, the following four questions have been
framed for and are directed primarily at governments,
whose responsibility it is to protect and fulfil the right to
education. However, the questions are also meant to be
used as advocacy tools by all education actors committed

Is this use of education technology appropriate for the national and local contexts? Education technology
should bring added value to support the strengthening of education systems and should align with
learning objectives.
Governments should therefore:






Reform curricula to target the teaching of the basic skills that are best suited to those digital tools that
have been proven to improve learning and are underpinned by a clear theory of how children learn,
without assuming either that pedagogy can remain the same or that digital technology is suitable to all
types of learning.
Design, monitor and evaluate education technology policies with the participation of teachers and
learners to draw on their experiences and contexts and ensure that teachers and facilitators are
sufficiently trained to understand how to use digital technology for learning, not simply how to use a
specific piece of technology.
Ensure that solutions are designed to fit their context, and that resources are available in multiple
national languages, are culturally acceptable and age-appropriate, and have clear entry points for
learners in given education settings.

Is this use of education technology leaving learners behind? Although technology use can enable access
to the curriculum for some students and accelerate some learning outcomes, digitalization of education
poses a risk of benefiting already privileged learners and further marginalizing others, thus increasing
learning inequality.
Governments should therefore:






Focus on how digital technology can support the most marginalized so that all can benefit from its
potential, irrespective of background, identity or ability, and ensure that digital resources and devices
comply with global accessibility standards.
Set national targets on meaningful school internet connectivity, as part of the SDG 4 benchmarking
process, and target investment accordingly to allow teachers and learners to benefit from a safe and
productive online experience at an affordable cost, in line with the right to free education.
Promote digital public goods in education, including free accessible e-pub formats, adaptable open
education resources, learning platforms, and teacher support applications, all designed so as not to
leave anyone behind.

Is this use of education technology scalable? There is an overwhelming array of technological products
and platforms in education and decisions are often made about them without sufficient evidence of their
benefits or their costs.
Governments should therefore:






25

Establish bodies to evaluate education technology, engaging with all actors that can carry out
independent and impartial research and setting clear evaluation standards and criteria, the aim being
to achieve evidence-based policy decisions on education technology.
Undertake pilot projects in contexts that accurately reflect the total cost of ownership and
implementation, taking into account the potentially higher cost of technology for marginalized learners.
Ensure transparency on public spending and terms of agreements with private companies to
strengthen accountability; evaluate performance to learn from mistakes, including on matters ranging
from maintenance to subscription costs, and promote interoperability standards to increase efficiency.

C H A P T E R 1 • I ntroduction

Does this use of technology support sustainable education futures? Digital technology should not be
seen as a short-term project. It should be leveraged to yield benefits on a sustainable basis and not be
led by narrow economic concerns and vested interests.
Governments should therefore:






Establish a curriculum and assessment framework of digital competences that is broad, not attached
to specific technology, takes account of what is learned outside school and enables teachers and
learners to benefit from technology’s potential in education, work and citizenship.
Adopt and implement legislation, standards and agreed good practices to protect learners’ and
teachers’ human rights, well-being and online safety, taking into account screen and connection
time, privacy, and data protection; to ensure that data generated in the course of digital learning and
beyond are analysed only as a public good; to prevent student and teacher surveillance; to guard
against commercial advertising in educational settings; and to regulate the ethical use of artificial
intelligence in education.
Consider the short- and long-term implications of digital technology deployment in education for the
physical environment, staying clear of solutions that are unsustainable in terms of their energy and
material requirements.

KE Y MESSAGES
Technology offers an education lifeline for millions but excludes many more.
Multiple types of technology bring education to hard-to-reach learners.


Radio delivers education at low cost and has a strong track record. Interactive audio instruction is used in nearly 40
countries.



Television can be effective when accompanied by in-person guidance. In Mexico, televised lessons combined with
in-class support helped increase secondary school enrolment by 18% between 1970 and 2020.



Online learning has increased participation for disadvantaged adults: 45% of students in India’s National Open
University are from rural areas and 18% from scheduled castes; 18% of the Open University’s students in the
United Kingdom have a disability.

Inclusive technology supports accessibility for students with disabilities.


Assistive technology removes learning barriers, but challenges persist. Affordability is a major issue in poor
countries. Teachers need appropriate training. In Saudi Arabia, most special education teachers had only beginner
knowledge of assistive technology.



Accessibility features embedded in platforms and devices support inclusive, personalized learning for all students.
In a study of visually impaired adults, 87% indicated that accessible technology devices were replacing traditional
assistive tools. They are especially critical in low-resource settings, where assistive technology is harder to find.

Technology can support learning continuity in emergencies, but it is not integrated in plans.


A mapping of 101 distance education projects in crisis contexts in 2020 showed that most education technology
projects in such contexts were led by non-state actors, leading to sustainability concerns; only 12% were
implemented by education ministries.

Technology supported learning during COVID-19, but millions were left out.

29



During school closures, over 90% of education ministries carried out some form of distance learning response, with
a potential reach of over 1 billion students globally. But at least half a billion students worldwide (31%) could not be
reached by remote learning, most being among the poorest (72%) and those living in rural areas (70%).



Despite 91% of countries using online learning platforms to deliver distance learning during school closures, these
platforms could only reach a quarter of students globally.



Less than half of countries have developed long-term strategies for increasing their resilience and the
sustainability of interventions as part of their COVID-19 response plans; 31% have abandoned distance learning
platforms developed during COVID-19, while others are repurposing platforms to reach marginalized learners. The
digital platform set up in Ukraine during the pandemic was expanded once war began in 2022, allowing 85% of
schools to complete the academic year.

A

ccess to learning remains a significant challenge
for those traditionally at risk of exclusion from
conventional schools and who need their specific
conditions catered for. The Education 2030 Framework for
Action states that ‘distance learning, ICT training, access to
appropriate technology and necessary infrastructure’ can
‘facilitate a learning environment at home and in conflict
zones and remote areas, particularly for ... marginalized
groups’ (UNESCO, 2015, sec. 57).
This chapter explores technology-supported education
delivery from three main angles: it reflects on how radio,
television, mobile devices and online learning have tackled
the hardest to reach from a historical perspective; it
discusses how technology has been harnessed to support
the education of learners with disabilities; and it examines
education disruptions caused by emergencies where
learning continuity relied on technology to reach
all learners – the COVID-19 pandemic being the
prime example.
This chapter also seeks to understand whether and how
technologies have helped increase participation rates
for marginalized groups, while at the same time drawing
attention to the fact that the application of technology
during COVID-19 disproportionately excluded those
very same groups. Technology interventions need to be
designed in ways that do not compromise the original
objective of serving the most disadvantaged.

Technology interventions need to be designed

MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES BRING
EDUCATION TO HARD-TO-REACH
LEARNERS
Technology has historically made education available
to learners facing obstacles in accessing school, good
instructional content and well-trained teachers due to
distant location, resource constraints and functional
difficulties. Study by correspondence, for example, was an
early form of distance learning used in the United States in
the 19th century to educate women and others restricted
from accessing formal education (Larreamendy-Joerns and
Leinhardt, 2006). In the mid-20th century, correspondence
education was used to educate children with long-term
illnesses and former prisoners in France (Marquet and
Xiao, 2008), and to deliver higher education in China (Li
and Chen, 2019). Print remains a crucial distance learning
medium (Mohn et al., 2022a), even as more interactive,
immediate and large-scale modalities, based on radio,
television and the internet, have been adopted (Sleator,
2010). For all these technologies, the key concern is how to
appropriately match technology with pedagogy.
RADIO DELIVERS EDUCATION AT A LOW COST AND
HAS A STRONG TRACK RECORD
Radio can be a cost-effective and sustainable education
technology. Considering that any school can be equipped
with radios, there are relatively low entry barriers,
although access remains limited at the household level.
Effective radio instruction programmes tend to be highly
learner-centred, interactive and local, relying on an
enabling policy environment that supports sustainability,
allows decentralized broadcasting and signals government
commitment (Damani and Mitchell, 2020; UNESCO, 2021c).
While traditional radio broadcasts are limited to
one-way delivery and require synchronous participation,
increasingly interactive approaches expect learners

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

30

2

to engage with and respond to radio lessons through
questions and exercises. Interactive instruction tends to
follow the national curriculum, combines audio recordings
and print materials, focuses on the active participation
of children, and makes use of an adult teacher to
facilitate learning. In most cases, radio remains the most
cost-effective option and reaches a large number of
learners (Damani and Mitchell, 2020; UNESCO, 2021c).

There is consistent and extensive evidence
that interactive radio-based instruction has
helped reduce education gaps between rural
and urban populations, girls and boys
Radio has a proven track record for delivering education
to underserved rural learners across the globe. There
is consistent and extensive evidence that interactive
radio-based instruction has helped reduce education
gaps between rural and urban populations, girls and
boys (UNICEF, 2021a), nomadic and settled communities,
and other disadvantaged children and their more privileged
peers, both in terms of access to education and quality
of learning (Damani and Mitchell, 2020; UNESCO, 2021c),
especially in sub-Saharan Africa (Box 2.1). Since the
1980s, studies in at least 25 countries have documented
statistically significant, consistent improvements in
student achievement that is positively correlated with
exposure to interactive radio instruction (Burns, 2021).
The first formal experiment with interactive radio
instruction, where learners ‘actively responded’ to
broadcasts, was carried out in Nicaragua in the 1970s
for children who were unable to complete their formal
schooling due to their agricultural livelihood. Participating
children quickly matched and even exceeded the
mathematics achievement of nearby formal school
students, despite the fact that many were not even
fluent in Spanish (UNESCO, 2021c). A more recent good
example of interactive radio instruction for marginalised
learners can be found in Cabo Verde, which has relied on
educational radio to reach remote learners for decades.
Evaluations have shown that children who had access to
the interactive radio programme Projeto PALOP tested
better in Portuguese and math compared to children who
did not (Burns et al., 2019).
Interactive audio instruction is implemented in almost
40 countries globally (UNESCO, 2021c). The distribution of
cassettes, CDs, MP3 files and mobile phones has allowed
rewinding, replaying and recording content, countering any

31

B OX 2. 1:

Alternative education systems in sub-Saharan
Africa often use radio
Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa use interactive
radio instruction as part of their alternative and distance
education systems. Radio remains the most cost-effective
means of reaching large numbers of out-of-school children
(UNESCO, 2021c).
In northern Nigeria, where millions of nomadic school-age
children face barriers to access, the National Commission for
Nomadic Education designed and developed a radio distance
learning strategy in 1996 based on evidence that nomadic
pastoralists tend to use radio sets, which they carried with
them while herding (Abdulrahman, 2016; Olaniran, 2018).
Despite implementation challenges such as limited funding
and untrained teachers (Okah, 2019; UNESCO, 2019), the
Commission continues to improve the programme by updating
the curriculum (Crossfire Reports, 2021) and establishing an
exclusive radio station for nomadic education, with broadcasts
in four languages (Gombe, 2022; Habib, 2019).
The radio strategy was designed to complement other
methods, including mobile schools equipped with audiovisual
materials, and increase enrolment and participation rates
(Olaniran, 2018). The quality of the programme’s interactivity
and delivery has increased over the years through the
establishment of radio listening groups, the development of
teaching and learning guides, and recordings of radio episodes
(Hanemann, 2017; Ugochukwu and Ezeah, 2020). Evaluations
have documented its effectiveness in reaching 77% of nomadic
pastoralists in North West Nigeria (Anorue et al., 2015) and
increasing literacy, numeracy and life skills (Nwokedi et al.,
2022; Ugochukwu and Ezeah, 2020).
In Zambia, the government first piloted an interactive radio
instruction programme in community learning centres for
out-of-school children and orphans who had lost their parents
to AIDS. In 2004, Learning at Taonga Market was launched, an
interactive audio instruction programme noted as the first to
use an MP3 player. Over the next 10 years, Learning at Taonga
Market programmes were delivered to 3,000 community
learning centres and 1.2 million students who consistently
outperformed their peers in formal government schools
(UNESCO, 2021c).
Interactive radio instruction programmes were also developed
in 2009 for grades 1 to 6 in French and mathematics in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo as part of the Projet
d’Amélioration de la Qualité de l’Éducation (Project for the
Improvement of the Quality of Education). They reached
3,000 schools, with 1.2 million students outperforming their
peers in control schools in reading (UNESCO, 2021c).

problems with radio reception. In Bangladesh,
primary school students improved their literacy and
numeracy scores through audio lessons using interactive
voice response delivered through mobile phones
(Wang et al., 2023). In Guyana, lessons from the
government’s radio programme in mathematics are
sometimes pre-recorded onto CDs or in MP3 format and
delivered with accompanying audio players to classrooms
(Guyana Ministry of Education, 2020).
The effectiveness of radio for teaching and learning
ultimately depends on available resources, the policy
environment, and specific educational needs and goals.
In some local contexts, interactive audio and radio
instruction has suffered from issues such as equipment
quality, reception, curriculum, scheduling and broadcasting
costs. Radio-based instruction is only cost-effective when
large numbers of students are reached; it is less efficient
when the target population is smaller, for instance with
learners who speak a minority language. Sustainability can
be supported through strong government commitment,
continuous teacher professional development,
the integration of programmes into existing curricula,
and effective monitoring and evaluation (Damani and
Mitchell, 2020; Grant et al., 2022; UNESCO, 2021c).
TELEVISION IS EFFECTIVE WHEN ACCOMPANIED BY
IN-PERSON GUIDANCE
Television has been used for delivering distance learning
since the 1950s, notably in Latin America (Box 2.2), to help
address qualified teacher shortages in rural areas and high
teacher absenteeism rates (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022;
Zacharia, 2020b). Lessons are often used to complement
face-to-face instruction, with long-term studies finding

significant impact on enrolment and completion rates.
Success has been partially attributed to community
participation and ongoing teacher training (Watson
and McIntyre, 2020), while the use of in-person tutors,
printed guides and videos that prompt learners to answer
questions has made interventions more interactive
(Mohn et al., 2022b). However, evidence on
cost-effectiveness is limited and viewership in rural
households is believed to be lower than in urban
households (Watson and McIntyre, 2020).
Several countries have introduced interactive televised
lessons to reduce gaps in access and learning for
students in rural areas (Navarro-Sola, 2021). In Ethiopia,
the government’s educational television programme
targeted at rural regions received mixed reviews on
its effectiveness due to a lack of interactivity and
technical support for teachers, which the Ministry of
Education has been working to address (Kim, 2015;
Tadesse, 2020). Evidence from China (Bianchi et al., 2022)
and Ghana (Johnston and Ksoll, 2022) suggests that,
when complemented by in-person support, interactive
elements and adequate teacher training, television-based
models can reduce learning gaps between rural and urban
populations.
However, not all interactive initiatives have succeeded.
Côte d’Ivoire (Wolff et al., 2002) and El Salvador
(Young et al., 2010) developed secondary education
programmes based on television instruction with support
from international agencies. They were later abandoned
due to high costs per student, teacher resistance to
centralized institutions and a lack of sustainability. Both
programmes ended once external financing ceased
(Wolff et al., 2002).

B OX 2.2:

Latin America’s long-standing televised instruction models have helped increase access to education
The Mexican government launched the Telesecundaria programme in the late 1960s to serve lower secondary school students in rural or
marginalized communities who did not have access to local schools (Craig et al., 2016; USAID, 2020). Each Telesecundaria delivers lessons
through television broadcasts in a classroom setting, following the national curriculum and complemented with learning guides and
in-classroom work and discussions (Navarro-Sola, 2021; Rodríguez et al., 2021). The programme, which forms the basis for education
in 60% of state schools (Mexico Government, 2020), has significantly expanded from serving some 3% of the total student population in
1970 to 20% in 2000, a level which has remained constant since (Figure 2.1).
It has been estimated that the programme increased the average enrolment rate by 21% between 1968 and 2000 (Navarro-Sola, 2021).
An additional telesecundaria per 1,000 adolescents led to an average increase of 0.2 years of education for both men and women
(Fabregas, 2019). However, the programme has been widely perceived as an option of lower quality, as telesecundaria students have
fared below those attending traditional schools in standardized tests, although studies have not accounted for a range of unobservable
socioeconomic characteristics that are likely to affect student outcomes (Fabregas, 2019; Navarro-Sola, 2021).

The programme’s effectiveness has been attributed to the use of appropriate technology, strong involvement of local communities,
domestic funding, extensive and continuous teacher training, and its blended environment, whereby televised lessons are combined with
in-class support (Fabregas, 2019; Navarro-Sola, 2021; Watson and McIntyre, 2020; Wolff et al., 2002). During the COVID-19 pandemic,
Mexico’s Aprende en Casa (Learning at Home) programme expanded the traditional telesecundaria approach with updated features
(Ripani and Zucchetti, 2020).

MOBILE LEARNING DEVICES CAN COMPLEMENT
EDUCATION IN CERTAIN SETTINGS
Given high levels of ownership even among the poor,
the mobile phone is the device with the greatest reach
that can be potentially applied to education. In 2018–21,
among the poorest 20% of households in 24 low- and
lower-middle-income countries, virtually none owned
a television, one quarter owned a radio and two thirds
owned a mobile phone (Figure 2.2). A distinction needs

Brazil has also been using television for educational purposes to
help address the unequal distribution of educational opportunities
(Filho, 2018). Launched in 1978, Telecurso was an initiative
launched by two foundations associated with major television
channels, one of which, TV Globo, broadcast the programmes.
In 1995, a new methodology based on specific curriculum and
learning materials, and continuous teacher training, monitoring
and evaluation, was implemented in classrooms through
partnerships with municipalities, state governments, and public
and private institutions. Telecurso does not require enrolment and
is freely available on television and the internet. An estimated
1.6 million students have completed primary and secondary
education through the initiative (Roberto Marinho Foundation,
2023). Apart from students in remote areas, it also targets young
adults who left primary or secondary school early. It provides
condensed instruction through direct programmes, videotaped
classroom sessions and textbooks, and involving teacher
supervision and complementary written materials (Watson and
McIntyre, 2020).
In the Brazilian state of Amazonas, the Amazonas State
Secretariat of Education established the State On-site
Technology-Mediated Instruction System in 2007, which uses
satellite transmission and a communication service platform
to provide secondary education on a large scale to isolated,
remote communities through television. Lessons are broadcast
in real time by trained teachers, with students supported by a
professional, face-to-face tutor in classrooms. The programme
expanded from 10,000 to over 30,000 secondary school students
between 2007 and 2022. While initially broadcast on a closed
television channel, the programme began broadcasting through
three public channels to cover the entire state school network
(Fundação Telefônica Vivo, 2022).

to be made between basic mobile phones that are not
internet enabled, feature phones, and smartphones;
studies on education impact have focused on the latter.
Mobile phones have been used for children in
hard-to-reach areas and emergencies (Kan et al., 2022).
In some instances, they can be an appropriate tool to
connect disadvantaged children and youth to distance
learning opportunities (Criollo-C et al., 2021; UNICEF,

2020b). Their use is usually focused on sharing educational
materials; complementing in-person and remote channels;
and fostering interactions between students, peers,
caregivers and teachers (Jordan and Mitchell, 2020;
Kan et al., 2022).
Due to high rates of ownership, low cost, flexibility,
durability and portability, mobile learning devices were
popular for providing access to education during the
COVID-19 pandemic. They facilitated the exchange of
learning materials in low- and middle-income countries,
as well as regular interaction between students, teachers
and parents (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022). In Bhutan,
70% of students used social media applications available
through phones to access lessons during the pandemic,

surpassing radio, television and online education platforms
(Bhutan Ministry of Education, 2021). In Indonesia, social
media and communication channels were among the
most widely used platforms for teaching, learning and
support. More than 5 million teachers reportedly used
WhatsApp groups for official information dissemination,
from pre-primary to tertiary education. Many study and
support groups were created among teachers, students
and parents (UNHCR, 2021).
Mobile phones were also used to maintain individual
support for families of children with disabilities during the
pandemic. In South Africa, a national WhatsApp support
line, using multiple languages, was established for those
families in need. It invited parents to engage with trained

facilitators to plan routines for home learning, supported
learners with homework, and provided stimulating learning
for preschool children (McAleavy et al., 2020).

Evidence is mixed on whether mobile
applications designed to improve learning
actually did so – and how

Evidence is mixed on whether mobile applications designed
to improve learning actually did so, as well as how. On
the one hand, phone-based surveys have suggested a
very low uptake of mobile applications: only 0.5% of
students claimed to have used any during COVID-19 in
Burkina Faso (Nkengne et al., 2020) even though at
least 79% of the poorest households and 94% of all
households owned a mobile phone. By contrast, about
40% followed radio and television education programmes
(Dang et al., 2021). On the other hand, mobile application
and platform providers claim higher utilization rates.
The mobile phone–based educational platform
Shupavu291, which operates in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and
Kenya, claims to have served some 5 million users (Jordan
and Mitchell, 2020).
ONLINE LEARNING DELIVERS FLEXIBLE
INSTRUCTION FOR HARD-TO-REACH LEARNERS
Prior to COVID-19, online learning had been used when
face-to-face instruction was too costly or unfeasible
(Burns, 2021). The considerable benefits included its
flexibility and association with self-paced, self-directed
and personalized learning. However, its efficacy relies on
student access to devices and the internet, with more
high-tech solutions like online courses not yet a practical
option for many learners due to the cost and lack of access
and digital skills. The biggest limitation of online learning
is that two thirds of the world’s children do not have an
internet connection in their homes (UNICEF and ITU, 2020).
In the Republic of Korea, where there is universal internet
access at home and a strong policy framework promoting
digital technology, metropolitan and provincial offices of
education have been operating online distance education
programmes since 2012 for nearly 10,000 secondary
school students who are failing to complete the curriculum
due to natural disasters, illness, exclusion, relocation
overseas, and work or childcare commitments (UNESCO,
2022). In Greenland (Denmark), where 40% of the
population lives outside the five major towns and 54% do

35

not progress beyond lower secondary level (Conyers,
2020), the government has introduced online distance
learning, which allows students to complete their upper
secondary education without having to relocate to a major
town (Greenland Government, 2022).
Sustainability and affordability concerns are raised when
online learning platforms that target marginalized learners
are operated by non-state actors. In Bangladesh, JAAGO
Foundation’s Digital Schools, which connects qualified and
trained teachers in a central location to remote primary
school classrooms through simple video conferencing
software, has described high attendance rates and good
learning outcomes for marginalized learners (Salam and
Ahmed, 2015). However, concerns were reported about
the project’s sustainability, as it relies on corporate social
responsibility funding and individual sponsors
(UNESCO, 2021b).
Non-state actors have also used online learning to
support the learning continuity of pregnant girls, young
mothers and young brides, where early childbearing and
marriage, social norms, and government policies keep
them out of schools. Most successful approaches include
study centres and in-person facilitation by a teacher or
trained community facilitator (Naylor and Gorgen, 2020).
In Afghanistan, as the Taliban regime has forbidden girls
to attend secondary education, many continue learning in
secret schools, of which a small number are online
(Banerji et al., 2021; The New Arab, 2021). In Bangladesh,
India and Pakistan, the GIRLS Inspire project uses open
and distance learning to reach girls who have been
prevented from attending school due to early marriage,
cultural norms and distance. Evaluations have found
that the project had a positive impact on access to
economic opportunities and the ability to make health
decisions, understand social rights and access resources
(Commonwealth of Learning, 2021; Ferreira, 2017).
ONLINE LEARNING HAS INCREASED PARTICIPATION
FOR DISADVANTAGED ADULTS
Adults have traditionally been the main target for online
distance education (Kara et al., 2019), with learners
often having competing work and family responsibilities
(Waterhouse et al., 2022). According to the Programme
for International Assessment of Adult Competencies,
key barriers to participation in adult learning include:
lack of time due to work commitments (28%), family
responsibilities (15%), lack of financial resources (16%),
and inconvenient times and places of training (12%)
(OECD, 2020).

Roughly three quarters of countries have reported
progress in recent years on improving the quality of adult
learning, mainly through the use of online technology (UIL,
2022a). The flexibility of online learning allows learners
to choose a time, rhythm and place compatible with their
work and family responsibilities. Moreover, online learning
is often cheaper than equivalent face-to-face provision
(OECD, 2020) and has the potential to reach adults who
missed the opportunities to acquire skills in childhood
and youth. Adults with caring responsibilities, mostly
women, tend to benefit from online study. In Australia,
a study of adult women found that the choice to study
online was largely determined by their family and caring
responsibilities and the desire to improve employment
opportunities (Stone and O’Shea, 2019).
In India, the Indira Gandhi National Open University,
the world’s largest university with over 3.3 million enrolled
students, serves traditionally marginalized communities
who would otherwise remain deprived of higher education.
It uses a multi-instructional system that includes print and
audiovisual materials, radio, television, web conferencing
and instant messaging. In 2020, 45% of enrolled students
were women, 12% scheduled tribes, 18% scheduled castes
and 18% from other backward classes. In addition, 45% of
enrolled students were from rural areas, up from 38% in
2016 (IGNOU, 2020).
The University of the South Pacific (USP) and the
University of the West Indies, owned and operated by
12 and 16 countries and territories respectively, have
relied on technology to deliver tertiary education since the
1970s (Bleeker, 2019; Hosman, 2019; Johnson et al., 2021).
Gradually moving from print to online platforms, USP has
opened up educational access to learners traditionally
considered unreachable (Naidu and Roberts, 2018;
Thonden, 2020). In 2021, over 30,000 students
were enrolled in face-to-face (37%), blended (24%),
online (22%) and print (17%) study modes (University
of the South Pacific, 2021).
In the United Kingdom, the Open University (OU)
was designed specifically to meet the needs of people
excluded from higher education due to barriers in time,
location and entry requirements. Gradually shifting from
printed material to online delivery, it remains the country’s

largest higher education provider (Pulker and Papi, 2021),
delivering education mainly through print, audiovisual
and online formats (Lindeiner-Stráský et al., 2020). Since
its launch in 1969, it has reached over 2.2 million people,
including full-time or part-time workers (70%) and people
living in the most deprived areas of the country (26%)
(Open University, 2022b). The university is also the largest
provider of higher education for people with disabilities
in Europe (Open University, 2022a): The percentage of
students with a disability increased from 3% in 2011 to
18% in 2020.
Online and distance learning can also facilitate access
to education for prisoners (Msoroka, 2019). In Nigeria,
a collaboration between the National Open University
of Nigeria and the Nigerian Prison Service offers online
distance learning programmes for prisoners, but lacks
the required funding to acquire e-learning facilities and
resources (Adeyeye, 2019).
Despite these advances, online distance education
students continue to face difficulties in balancing work
and/or family roles with studying (Kara et al., 2019). Time,
or lack thereof, appears to be the predominant source
of conflict between roles (Waterhouse et al., 2022).
A survey of current OU students and graduates found that
role conflict was significantly associated with student
satisfaction, while student determination to continue with
studies resulted in difficult trade-offs. The trade-off of
reducing working hours to devote more time to studying,
for example, can have major economic consequences
(Samra et al., 2021). These challenges have so far not been
addressed effectively by massive open online courses,
which had originally presented much promise in the 2000s
(Chapter 3).

INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGIES SUPPORT
ACCESSIBILITY FOR STUDENTS WITH
DISABILITIES
People with disabilities face some of the most significant
barriers in accessing quality education. Technology
provides multiple means of representing information,
expressing knowledge and engaging in learning, which
can support people with disabilities, providing fair and
optimized access to the curriculum, while developing their

The flexibility of online learning allows learners to choose a time, rhythm and

independence, agency and social inclusion (UNESCO, 2020;
UNICEF, 2021b). It can facilitate personalized learning
(United Nations, 2022), communication and interaction
with their peers and teachers, and stronger social skills and
networks (Dinechin and Boutard, 2021; World Bank, 2022).

People with disabilities face some of the
most significant barriers in accessing quality
education

Societies should aim to ensure that products,
environments, programmes and services follow universal
design principles ‘to be usable by all people to the
greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation
or specialized design’ (United Nations, 2006, p. 4). This
concept was extended to curriculum design: the Universal
Design for Learning is ‘a set of principles for curriculum
development that give all individuals equal opportunities
to learn’ (Association for Higher Education, Access and
Disability, 2017). A mix of accessible technology and
assistive devices in a classroom founded on the principles
of Universal Design for Learning enhances all students’
potential. Technology provides personalized options
to diversify the means of engagement, representation
and expression. For instance, captioned videos and
touchscreen technologies, originally intended to assist
autistic students, are popular with most teachers and
students. Students without visual disabilities tend to
prefer e-books with audio input. While Universal Design
for Learning does not depend on access to technology,
appropriate and sustainable educational technology can
greatly support its application in education. However, in the
absence of good guidance on how to operationalize it,
many countries continue to rely on assistive devices where
available (Banes et al., 2020; World Bank, 2022).
A variety of technologies are available for people with
disabilities who face various barriers to education and
learning (Lynch et al., 2022) (Table 2.1). Assistive and
accessible technologies should be individualized to
students’ specific learning needs, as not all technologies
are applicable for students with the same type of disability.
Technology provision without appropriate teacher training
can result in ineffective use or inappropriate selection of
technologies for specific children (Banes et al., 2020).
A global survey of professionals engaged with the use
education of technology for disability-inclusive education
found that computers, text-to-speech technologies, Braille
writing equipment, and augmentative and alternative

37

communication technologies were most commonly used.
Their purpose was to help students access textbook and
curriculum-related material (26%), improve communication
skills (25%), improve social skills (15%), increase knowledge
of sign language (10%), improve daily life skills (9%),
aid mobility (4%), and help with seating and posture (4%)
(World Bank, 2022).
ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES REMOVE LEARNING
BARRIERS BUT CHALLENGES PERSIST
While education technology supports the teaching and
learning of all students, assistive technologies are those
that have been modified in some way to ‘assist’ individuals
with disabilities to perform functions that they might
otherwise find difficult or impossible (Burns, 2021). They
are used to ‘overcome the social, infrastructural and other
barriers to [learning] independence, full participation
in society and carrying out [learning] activities safely
and easily’ (Hersh and Johnson, 2008, p. 196). They
can include input technology (e.g. adapted keyboards),
output technology (e.g. screen readers), alternative
and augmentative communication (replacing speech)
and assistive listening systems (improving sound clarity).
They range from low- to high-tech devices
(Lynch et al., 2022).
Assistive technologies support the social inclusion of
people with disabilities as well as provide learners and
educators with tools to create more inclusive learning
environments by removing in- and out-of-classroom
barriers to learning (Migeon et al., 2021; UNICEF, 2021b).
As they are designed for specific types of impairment,
they support personalized, targeted instruction that
can accommodate students’ sometimes conflicting
needs (Hersh and Mouroutsou, 2019) and lessen learner
dependence on teachers (Burns, 2021).
A study of secondary school students with disabilities in
the United States found that the group reportedly using
assistive technology to the greatest extent were deaf-blind
students (74%) and students with visual impairments (71%).
Students with disabilities who were least likely to report
using assistive technology were students with speech
and language impairments (15%), students with learning
difficulties (19%), and students with emotional/behaviour
disorders (19%) (Bouck and Long, 2021).
Assistive technologies have a positive impact on the
education of learners with disabilities, including improved
graduation rates, self-esteem, independence, performance
and optimism (Bouck and Long, 2021; UNESCO, 2020).

Insufficient training and external support limit
the extent to which learners with disabilities
can engage with assistive technology in higher
education
10 countries, including Israel, Kenya and Türkiye,
reported significant positive impacts in academic
engagement, psychological well-being and social
participation. However, insufficient training and external
support limit the extent to which learners with disabilities
can engage with assistive technology in higher education
(McNicholl et al., 2021).
Students with motor disabilities receive support
through adapted trackballs, adapted computer mice and
joysticks, switches, and alternate keyboards (Burns,
2021). In Taiwan Province of China, the use of eye-gaze
assistive technology for children aged 3 to 6 with

severe motor and communication difficulties increased
their participation in computer activities at home and
educational environments, attaining goals related to play,
communication and school learning (Hsieh et al., 2022).
For students who are blind or have visual impairments,
assistive technology provides cognitive benefits and
improves academic performance and learning capacity
(Senjam et al., 2020). In the United Republic of Tanzania,
for instance, it increased students’ self-confidence and
independence (52%), enhanced interactions with lecturers
and learning content (33%), and increased access to
electronic materials (Kisanga and Kisanga, 2022). In Kenya,
tablets with screen reader and keyboards enabled blind
students to autonomously access university material and
significantly improved their access to higher education
(Dinechin and Boutard, 2021). Although learning to read
and write in Braille is needed to understand spelling
and how text is formatted, text-to-voice software and
audiobooks are helpful (Banes et al., 2020).

Students who are deaf or have hearing impairments
can also benefit from technology-based approaches.
In the United States, deaf preschoolers who use sign
language developed significant early reading skills when
using shared interactive storybooks with sign language
videos (Andrews et al., 2017). While subtitles and closed
captions for videos can greatly help these students access
auditory content, they do not replace the need to learn
and communicate directly using sign languages with peers
and trained professionals who are fluent in sign language
(Banes et al., 2020).
Although not specifically targeted to students with
learning difficulties, assistive technologies have been
reported to offer benefits such as independence; selecting
a preferred pace; improved quality of academic work; and
greater engagement with cooperative, in-class activities
(Bouck and Long, 2021). In Sweden, about half of learners
with reading and writing difficulties reported that assistive
technology supported reading and general schoolwork
(Svensson et al., 2021).
Communication applications, speech synthesizers,
augmentative and alternative communication software,
sign language resources and hearing aid microphones
have been used to support students with autism spectrum
disorder (Hersh, 2020) who may face challenges in
communicating through verbal speech (Banes et al., 2020;
Lynch et al., 2022). In China, special educators reported
that a tablet-compatible augmentative and alternative
communication application increased the engagement of
children with high-functioning autism (Hu and Han, 2019).
Assistive devices have helped students with intellectual
disabilities enhance their independence and education
(Boot et al., 2018). A global, systematic review for children
with Down syndrome found that assistive technology can
help the development of numeracy, speech, language,
memory and social skills (Shahid et al., 2022).
The availability of assistive technology varies greatly both
between and within countries. A study in Bangladesh,
India and Nepal found that lack of accessibility, eligibility,
reachability and affordability prevented access to assistive
technology (Karki et al., 2021). In Australia, assistive
technologies are available for English speakers but not
in Aboriginal languages (Hersh and Mouroutsou, 2019).
In Malawi, only 6% of the 57% of persons with disabilities
who needed assistive technology were able to receive it
(Eide and Munthali, 2018).
The more specialized the device, the greater the need for
specialized training for teachers to use it effectively in the
learning environment (Lynch et al., 2022). But teachers
often lack specialized training (National Centre for

39

Learning Disabilities, 2020). In Saudi Arabia, 54% of special
education needs teachers had only basic knowledge of
using assistive technologies, while 28% received no training
in implementing such technologies, and 10% had no
knowledge at all on using them (Aldehami, 2022).
Stigma and discrimination can also prevent the use of
assistive technology. Although these devices are designed
to increase human function and learning, they can make
disabilities more visible and reinforce negative attitudes.
Stigma can be reduced by using designs that are small,
attractive and similar to general-purpose devices, which do
not match the stereotypes of the appearance of assistive
technology. A study of European students revealed that
aesthetics greatly influences how assistive technologies
and their users are perceived, while user adaptation
was important for assistive technology adoption or
abandonment (Santos et al., 2022).
Accessibility features are being embedded in
platforms and devices
Until recently, people with disabilities relied exclusively
on specialized devices to gain access to education.
However, an increasing number of platforms and devices,
including smartphones, computers and tablets, have
been embedding accessibility and personalization
features, such as built-in screen readers, voice control,
immersive readers, word prediction and text-to-speech/
speech-to-text tools (Dinechin and Boutard, 2021).
Accessible technologies have advantages over assistive
technology, including easier availability, reduced costs,
device familiarity and reduced stigma; they often allow
learners with disabilities to use the same technologies
as other students (Hersh, 2020). These technologies
greatly support inclusive learning for all students,
allowing assistive technology to play a complementary
role. According to a study of visually impaired adults,
87% indicated that accessible technology devices, including
smartphones and tablets, were replacing traditional
assistive tools most or all of the time, stating that it was
important for them to use devices that are widely adopted
by the general public and address a range of user abilities
and needs. Traditional devices were still preferred for
certain tasks, such as those requiring extensive typing
(Martiniello et al., 2022).
The use of accessible technology has been especially
critical in low resource settings, which face significant
challenges in providing assistive technology. In Kenya,
a study on the impact of tablets found that they not only
provided access to higher education for students with
visual impairment comparable to that of their fully sighted
peers, they also provided students with the opportunity

C H A P T E R 2 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess for disadvantaged groups

2

to create a community of practice and participate in
everyday life (Foley and Masingila, 2015). Another Kenyan
study found that mobile phones helped 36% of people with
visual impairment to access education, a figure that rose
to 71% for those owning a smartphone, as it gave them
access to assistive technologies essential for studying,
such as screen readers (Aranda-Jan and Boutard, 2019).

TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS LEARNING
CONTINUITY AND SYSTEM RESILIENCE IN
EMERGENCIES
In emergency contexts, technology can support distance
learning and increase the resilience of education systems
(Tauson and Stannard, 2018). In protracted displacement
settings, technology is being deployed in similar ways
to those education systems that are not in a state of
emergency. For instance, the UN Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) began
a full-scale digital transformation process in 2021, which
also extended to its education programme, covering
over half a million Palestine refugee students. UNRWA
maintains a YouTube channel and a Digital Learning
Platform from which more than 7,000 self-learning
materials have been downloaded 6 million times.
The materials are complemented by interactive digital
teaching and learning materials. As part of the Agency’s
ICT for Education Strategy, the learning platform will be
integrated with the education management information
system, creating a fully fledged interactive learning
management system (UNRWA, 2022).

In emergency remote learning settings,
solutions largely rely on the current skills,
knowledge and resources available to students
and teachers
In emergency remote learning settings, solutions largely
rely on the current skills, knowledge and resources
available to students and teachers (Crompton et al.,
2021). The scalability, speed, mobility and portability
of technology interventions can address disruptions
affecting refugee education, such as distance, lack of
resources, language barriers and exclusion from formal
learning opportunities (Ashlee et al., 2020). Mobile learning
technology is particularly well suited for displacement
settings (Alencar, 2020; Ashlee et al., 2020). About
4 in 10 refugee households have access to mobile phones
(UNESCO, 2019). A mapping of 101 distance education
projects in emergency and emergency-prone contexts
in 2020, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, showed
that 70% were using low-tech interventions (e.g. radio,

TV and basic mobile phones), 62% high-tech interventions
(e.g. tablets and smartphones) and 33% paper-based
interventions (INEE, 2020).
Courses delivered via online and blended learning models
have increased refugees’ access to higher education.
Kiron Open Higher Education is provided to refugees
free of charge (Martin and Stulgaitis, 2022; UNESCO,
2021d). It is estimated that 14,000 learners have enrolled
in 73,000 courses, of which over 21,000 have been
completed (UIL, 2021).
Some applications and technology-assisted learning
initiatives support language learning; not being able
to speak the host country language is one of the main
barriers which prevent forcibly displaced people from
participating in host countries’ formal education systems.
UNICEF’s Akelius Digital Language Learning Course
uses mobile phones, tablets and computers to support
language learning among refugees, migrants and linguistic
minorities through a blended learning approach. The course
was first introduced in Greece in 2017 and, as of 2022,
had been implemented in 10 countries, including Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Italy, Lebanon, Mauritania, and Serbia
(Dreesen et al., 2021; UNICEF, 2022b). Evidence from
Greece found that the course improved students’ Greek
writing and speaking skills and encouraged student
attendance (Karamperidou et al., 2020). Still, there is
limited evidence that mobile applications can effectively
support refugees in acquiring proficiency in a foreign
language and can only complement in-person language
courses, where learners have more opportunities to
engage in conversational activities (UNESCO, 2018).
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the interactive
radio project Making Waves reached more than
2,000 out-of-school children aged 12 to 16. Making Waves
combines radio lessons with teacher-facilitated instruction
and group work. Students scored higher on all reading and
mathematics subtasks when assessed compared to those
studying traditional alternative learning programmes
(INEE, 2022). In Jordan, the TIGER programme, which uses
low-cost tablets, helped girls in the Za’atari refugee camp
stay in secondary school and increased their desire to learn
(Wagner, 2017) and managed to bring some out-of-school
adolescent girls back to school (UNESCO, 2018).
The Instant Network School Programme in the Dadaab
refugee camp in Kenya, which uses internet-enabled
tablets, increased participation rates (Vodafone
Foundation, 2017).
At the height of the Boko Haram crisis in the Nigerian
state of Adamawa , the Technology Enhanced Learning
for All programme used mobile and radio technology to
support the learning continuity of 22,000 disadvantaged

2

children, including internally displaced children, itinerant
Islamic school students and orphans aged 6 to 17.
Within six months of listening to the programme, there
was improvement in literacy and numeracy skills,
with a sharper improvement observed among girls.
The combination of mobile classroom visits with radio
instruction was more effective: beneficiaries exposed to
both learning modalities outperformed those exposed only
to the radio programme by 25% (Jacob and Ensign, 2020).

ideas that had already been tested. Many of the resources
used during the pandemic were first developed in response
to previous emergencies or rural education, with some
countries building on decades of experience with remote
learning (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022). For instance, online
learning platforms were originally used during the SARS
and H1N1 outbreaks in the 2000s in countries such as
the Plurinational State of Bolivia, China and Singapore
(Barbour, 2021; Hallgarten et al., 2020).

In Chad, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan and Uganda, with the
support of teachers and facilitators, the programme, Can’t
Wait to Learn, used a tablet-based gaming programme
integrated into the national curriculum to deliver learning
to non-formal classroom settings for out-of-school,
refugee and forcibly displaced children (Burns et al.,
2019; Koomar et al., 2020; Topham, 2019; UNESCO,
2021a). An evaluation showed that the programme
led to significantly greater learning improvements for
children aged 7 to 9 in Sudan compared to state-provided
education for out-of-school children (Brown et al., 2020).
Children achieved nearly twice the learning gains in
mathematics, and nearly three times the learning gains
in reading compared to those learning through traditional
approaches (Topham, 2019). The model had reached
30,000 children by the end of 2020 (UNESCO, 2021a).

Some countries relied on a combination of interventions
to maintain learning continuity: 91% of countries delivered
remote learning through online platforms while 85% did so
through television, 82% through paper-based materials,
70% through mobile phones and 54% through radio. Radio
was the most popular modality deployed in low-income
countries (85%) and online platforms the most popular
modality in high-income countries (World Bank et al.,
2021).

However, despite some evidence of impact, there are
gaps in terms of the evaluation of technology applications
in education in emergencies. This may be because most
interventions are being implemented as short-term crisis
responses by non-state actors and donors, which also
raises concerns for sustainability (Menashy and Zakharia,
2017; UNESCO, 2019). The mapping of 101 distance
education projects in emergency and emergency-prone
contexts found that only 12% were implemented by
education ministries; more interventions were led by
UN agencies (56%) and international non-governmental
organizations (20%) (INEE, 2020). In many of these cases,
technology was viewed as a solution for refugee education
(Menashy and Zakharia, 2020) instead of as a supportive
tool (UIL, 2022b).
TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTED LEARNING DURING
COVID-19, BUT MILLIONS WERE LEFT OUT
During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 90% of education
ministries carried out some form of distance learning
policy response. It has been estimated that these had a
potential reach of over 1 billion students globally, from
pre-primary to upper secondary (Avanesian et al., 2021).
Most countries were able to respond quickly because they
were expanding on existing infrastructure, mobilizing
pre-existing knowledge and networks, or implementing

41

At least 31% of students from pre-primary
to upper secondary level could not be
reached by remote learning

Despite these measures, at least 31% of students,
or almost half a billion students worldwide from
pre-primary to upper secondary level, could not be reached
by remote learning due to lack of access to necessary
technology or targeted policies geared towards their
needs. The region with the highest share of children (49%)
who could not be reached during school closures was
sub-Saharan Africa, which experienced full and partial
school closures of about one year (Avanesian et al., 2021;
Muñoz-Najar et al., 2021).
Location and income were the two key factors affecting
the reach of remote learning policies. Globally, school-age
children in rural areas and from the poorest 40% of
households accounted for 70% and 72% of those who
could not be reached during school closures, respectively
(Avanesian et al., 2021). In Viet Nam, students from the
poorest 20% and the less-educated households were
34% and 21% less likely to experience distance learning,
respectively, than those from the richest 20% and from
higher-educated households (Hossain, 2021).
The highest reach of distance learning was recorded in
Latin America and the Caribbean (91%) (Avanesian et al.,
2021). Uruguay launched Ceibal en Casa immediately
after school closures were announced, drawing on the

C H A P T E R 2 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess for disadvantaged groups

2

pre-existing deployment of digital resources under its
National Digital Education Plan, or Plan Ceibal. Due to high
levels of household internet access (88%), Ceibal en Casa
relied primarily on digital media (with complementary
content for students with no internet connectivity)
and reached 85% of primary and 90% of secondary
students (Ripani, 2020).
Despite their wide deployment during school closures,
online platforms could at best reach only a quarter
of children globally (Avanesian et al., 2021). Even
in high-income countries, access was difficult for
disadvantaged students. School leaders in England,
United Kingdom, reported that 28% of their students had
little to no access to technology at home for distance
learning, a figure which was higher for the most deprived
(43%) compared to the least deprived (18%) schools
(Sharp et al., 2020). In another survey of English teachers,
only 5% of government school teachers reported that
all their students had access to an appropriate device
for remote learning, compared to 54% of private school
teachers (Montacute and Cullinane, 2021).
Radio and television proved they could be part of an
active learning strategy when complemented by phone
or paper-and-pencil assignments, providing students
with additional (or alternative) learning opportunities
(Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022). China, which has one of
the longest histories of using education television for
adult learning and teacher training, launched EduTV,
which reached 97% of students during the educational
disruption (Zacharia, 2020b). Mexico built on its
Telesecundaria programme to deploy Aprende en Casa
almost immediately after the suspension of face-to-face
classes, mainly drawing on audiovisual content broadcast
across a network of TV stations streamed through
internet platforms. Content was expanded from secondary
education to all levels of education, with a special radio
strategy implemented to reach indigenous students,
and 300,000 printed educational materials delivered
to students in rural and isolated communities with no
internet access. It was reported that 82% of teachers had
weekly interactions with 9 out of 10 of their students
(Ripani and Zucchetti, 2022).
However, there were problems in access and engagement.
Whereas television served as the main distance learning
platform for 94% of students in Côte d’Ivoire, only 65% of
students in rural areas had access to a television at
home, compared to 90% in urban areas (Côte d’Ivoire
Ministry of National Education, 2020). In the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (PDR), where distance learning was
mainly implemented through television (Lao PDR Ministry
of Education and Sports, 2021), only 29% of households

reported that their school-aged children engaged in
remote learning activities during school closure, with a
disparity between urban (41%) and rural (24%) households
(World Bank, 2021a). The education ministry instructed
teachers in remote communities to meet with small groups
of children for face-to-face teaching, but there was no
monitoring of how many students were reached (UNICEF
and UNESCO, 2021).
Sierra Leone, which has been using educational radio
since the 1960s (Zacharia, 2020a), revived the Radio
Teaching Programme developed during the Ebola crisis
one week after schools closed (Gutierrez and Wurie, 2021).
The government made the programme more interactive
and expanded its coverage to remote communities
through satellite connections and solar-powered radios.
Printed materials, mobile phones and television also
complemented the programme (Sierra Leone Ministry
of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, 2020), while a
toll-free telephone line facilitated two-way interaction
(Muñoz-Najar et al., 2021). However, less than half
the children (41%) listened to the radio lessons during
COVID-19 school closures. Barriers included lack of
motivation and competing priorities (Gutierrez and Wurie,
2021).
More generally, the pandemic has shown that many
learners did not have the devices or connectivity required
for low- and high-tech interventions. For these students,
paper-based materials served as the primary resource
for remote learning or as a supplementary resource in
combination with other interventions (UNICEF, 2021a).
In Bhutan, some 17,000 students in remote areas had
limited or no access to broadcasting services or the
internet. An initiative called Reaching the Unreached
provided them with self-instructional materials. Almost all
schools in the country accessed the booklets, finding them
effective (80%) and user-friendly (84%), except for students
in lower primary classes, for whom the materials were
challenging to use without guidance (Bhutan Ministry of
Education, 2021).

The pandemic has shown that many learners
did not have the devices or connectivity
required for low- and high-tech interventions

In Cambodia, the government provided paper-based
learning materials for the most vulnerable students,
and complemented these with text and Telegram
messages for teacher–student follow-up

(Muñoz-Najar et al., 2021). Approximately 70% of students
could access some form of distance learning, although
disparities in learning outcomes between rural and urban
areas, and between poor and rich households, increased
(UNICEF, 2020a). While the government in Ethiopia made
provisions for distance learning through radio, television
and social media, only 8% of a sample of adolescents in
urban areas reported radio or television as their primary
distance learning method; 58% used their own textbooks
(Jones et al., 2021).
Gender barriers were observed in some contexts,
regardless of the modality. In Kenya, 74% of adolescent
girls – but only 46% of boys – reported that household
chores distracted them from remote learning (Kenya
Presidential Policy and Strategy Unit and Population
Council, 2021). In Ethiopia, only 35% of girls were given
a space to study, compared to 62% of boys, and only
22% of girls had their time spent on chores reduced to
accommodate home study versus 57% of boys
(Jones et al., 2021).
Furthermore, even when access to distance learning was
possible, there was observed inequality in the resources
and skills needed to use technology effectively, including
parental engagement and support, which is critical in
facilitating remote learning (Muñoz-Najar et al., 2021).
In England, United Kingdom, the most common reason
given by teachers to explain why students did not engage
in online learning was limited or no parental support (60%),
which affected government schools (65%) much more than
private schools (25%) (Montacute and Cullinane, 2021).
Just as technology can offer learners with disabilities a
lifeline, the pandemic disproportionately excluded these
types of learners because remote learning modalities were
not adequately prepared for sign language interpretation,
closed captioning or Braille, among other issues (World
Bank et al., 2021). A global online survey of parents
and caregivers found that only 12% of students with
visual impairments had access to Braille materials and
only 10% of deaf learners had access to transcripts of
audio services (World Bank, 2020). In at least half of the
countries surveyed by the International Disability Alliance,
governments had not adopted measures for these learners
(IDA, 2021; UNESCO IITE, 2021). A global online survey
showed that only 19% of teachers who had learners
with a disability reported that their students continued
learning during school closures, and only 16% said they had
the support needed to continue helping these students
(World Bank, 2021b). In Ghana, the Ministry of Education
designed distance learning packages to respond to the
learning needs of children with disabilities (Ghana Ministry
of Education, 2020) but teachers and parents reported

43

that radio and television content had not been adapted
for children with disabilities and remained inaccessible to
them (Innovations for Poverty Action, 2021).
Nevertheless, several countries did implement targeted
interventions, the most effective of which prioritized
communication channels that could reach a large
number of families while also exploring specific solutions
for learners that needed more careful interventions;
for example, those in isolated regions, learners with
disabilities and refugees (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022).
France placed emphasis on the learning continuity
of students with disabilities through special needs
coordinators, medical professionals and social care
staff, as well as the provision of adaptive and accessible
learning resources. The needs of students with disabilities
were also factored into the design of the national online
learning platform, Ma classe à la maison (My class at
home), while the teaching of students with disabilities
was further supported through the Ministry of Education
website Éduscol, and regional online academies for teacher
professional development (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022).
In the Republic of Korea, all students with disabilities were
individually assessed before school closures. Customized
learning was provided accordingly, including online class
materials with subtitles and sign language, materials in
Braille, distribution of assistive devices, and home visits to
check that learners were engaged and had access to the
necessary adaptations. Distance learning materials were
made available in three additional languages – Chinese,
Russian and Vietnamese – to support students from
multicultural families. Almost all students with special
needs and disabilities participated in the distance learning
programme during school closures, with a 99% total
participation rate and 81% student satisfaction rate
(McAleavy et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2022).
During school closures in South Sudan, multigrade
radio programmes were designed to include refugee
learners, teachers provided targeted support to
learners with disabilities through home visits. Learners
without access to radios were supported through the
distribution of 5,000 solar-powered radios. More than
10,000 out-of-school children re-entered school
through the provision of radios and the radio
programme (UNHCR, 2021).

2

For disadvantaged students to benefit, the model of
distance learning must recognize the scale of the digital
divide. For instance, the school closure plan for Papua
New Guinea was based on analysis which recognized
the technology capacity of a large sample of schools
contrasted with the lack of electricity and radios at
home. On the advice of head teachers who considered
writing materials and textbooks as the most helpful type
of support, the government organized remote learning,
mainly through printed workbooks, supplemented by
educational radio (Papua New Guinea Department of
Education, 2020). In Peru, where only 24% of households
are connected to the internet, the government deployed
a multimodal strategy that used television and radio
(available to 80% of households) as well as online learning.
Take-up was high, with Aprendo en Casa reaching almost
85% of students (Muñoz-Najar et al., 2021). In contrast,
in the Islamic Republic of Iran, two weeks after the launch
of the national e-learning platform SHAD, which required
a smartphone with internet access, only 50% of teachers
and 25% of students had been able to enrol, with enrolment
levels even lower in the country’s poorer provinces
(Ershad, 2020).
The experience of COVID-19 shows that education
systems must become more resilient to cope with
future crises. Two thirds of countries plan to enhance
the provision of hybrid learning from primary to upper
secondary levels beyond the pandemic (UIS et al., 2022).
Analysis from the GEM Report team shows that, as part
of their COVID-19 response plans, 40% of countries have
developed long-term, sustainable strategies to increase
their resilience. Cambodia’s COVID-19 Education Response
Plan is underpinned by a mid- to long-term, multirisk and
sustainability-oriented approach, aimed at strengthening
the education ministry’s preparedness, response, recovery
and existing distance learning programmes (Cambodia
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, 2020).
Not all countries have succeeded in their intentions.
For instance, 32% of national digital learning platforms no
longer exist, have links that do not work or have not been
updated since 2020 (UNICEF, 2022b).
Programming created or enhanced during COVID-19 can
be repurposed to support distance education in other
contexts. During the war in Ukraine, where millions of
children were prevented from attending school and
nearly 700,000 students were displaced, the Ministry
of Education provided learning continuity through the
expansion of the All-Ukrainian Online School digital
platform that had been established during the pandemic,
allowing 85% of schools to complete the 2021/22 academic
year (Saavedra, 2022; UNICEF, 2022a).

CONCLUSION
Education systems have long relied on technology to reach
groups who are traditionally excluded from education,
and to support learning continuity during emergencies.
Technological solutions are sometimes the only option
many learners have for education. Certain long-standing
programmes, such as radio-based instruction for nomads
or televised instruction for remote areas, have helped
increase enrolment and participation for marginalized
populations. Throughout the years, countries have
worked on improving existing interventions, increasing
the interactivity of traditionally one-way broadcasting
technologies, and embedding accessibility and
personalization features in platforms and devices.

Technology should not be viewed as
the solution, but as a supportive tool
in overcoming certain barriers to
education access
Technology should not be viewed as the solution, but as a
supportive tool in overcoming certain barriers to education
access. The most effective interventions are those that put
learners’ interests as the focal point and support human
interaction, making use of adequate in-person support,
extensive teacher training and appropriate technology for
the specific context. The best learning systems never rely
on technology alone.
Interventions must be backed up by strong evidence that
they are the most effective tool to reach the targeted
learners and respond to identified needs. In contexts of
displacement, only technology’s potential is seen, with
less evidence and rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness
in increasing access to marginalized groups; interventions
remain small scale and largely non-state led. Focusing
on the sustainability of interventions is key, especially as
emergencies become more frequent and many children
remain out of reach from conventional schooling systems.
Countries can build on prior distance learning experience
to quickly respond to these crises, repurpose already
developed platforms, and build interventions that put the
needs of the most marginalized learners at the centre.
These are often the learners who stand to benefit the
most from technology-supported education, while at
the same time, as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, they
can be disproportionately excluded if their needs are not
adequately recognized and actively prioritized.

KE Y MESSAGES
Technology makes it so much easier to create and share educational content that the quality of content is
increasingly hard to ensure.
Technology facilitates content creation and adaptation.


Open educational resources facilitate affordable, efficient and more inclusive content creation. A shift to such
resources resulted in over USD 1 million in savings for students in the US state of North Dakota in 2018.



Collaborative tools can improve diversity and quality in content creation. In South Africa, the Siyavula initiative
supported tutors in collaborating on creating textbooks for primary and secondary education.



Social media improves access to user-generated content and sharing. YouTube is used by about 80% of the world’s
top 113 universities.

Digitization simplifies content distribution channels.


Digitizing textbooks can increase their availability and introduce new ways of learning. India uses QR codes
for additional content and Sweden developed collaborative textbooks that provide a multimodal experience.
Digitization also promotes inclusivity. But digital textbooks’ growth has been slowed by resistance from publishers.



Digital libraries and educational content repositories help learners and teachers discover more content. Examples
include the National Academic Digital Library of Ethiopia, National Digital Library of India and Bangladesh's
Teachers Portal, which has over 600,000 users.



Learning management platforms are becoming part of contemporary learning environments. They were valued at
USD 14 billion in 2021, with projected growth to USD 41 billion by 2029. Low-income countries often use social
media as learning management systems.

Technology that is used to increase access to content faces challenges.

47



Mass open online courses (MOOCs) reduce time, location and cost barriers to access. In Indonesia, they provide
post-secondary education in rural areas.



But expansion has happened without due diligence or planning. The quality of MOOCs is questionable, with
completion rates below 5% and multiple-choice quizzes often used as assessments. Quality assurance approaches,
such as the OpenupED quality label in the European Union and government oversight in China, along with microcredentials, are among strategies to address quality concerns.



Technology increases access mostly to those who already have it. MOOCs mainly benefit learners from richer
countries due to divides in digital skills, internet access, language and course design.



Technology can reinforce gender, language and cultural inequality in content production, with creation dominated
by privileged groups. A study of higher education repositories with open educational resource collections found
that nearly 90% were created in Europe or North America, and 92% of the material in the OER Commons global
library is in English, which influences who can use such content.

A

ccess to quality educational resources remains one of
the main challenges for education systems worldwide
(Janssen et al., 2023). Technology has the power to improve
access to educational content in at least three ways. First,
it fosters content development (see Chapter 5) by making
creation, adaptation and sharing easier – concepts
strongly rooted in the open education movement. Second,
it expands storage through digitization – creating digital
formats of resources – and improves distribution channels
with digital libraries, online repositories and learning
management systems. Third, technology helps remove
costs and other barriers, such as language, to accessing
materials.
Nevertheless, several challenges remain before technology
can achieve its full potential of increasing access to
educational materials. The overwhelming quantity and
decentralized production of digital content make it harder
to ensure quality. And technological innovations can
reinforce traditional biases associated with who produces
content, and who benefits from it.

TECHNOLOGY FACILITATES CONTENT
CREATION AND ADAPTATION
Content development can be divided in two phases: its
original development and its subsequent adaptations,
modifications and edits. Technology can help in both
phases. Digital tools allow content to be produced and
shared in cheaper and more efficient ways. It also allows
more actors to participate in the process, going beyond
traditional, institutionally-centred content production.
Technology is also particularly useful in the second
phase of content development, fostering co-creation
and adaptation through the open education movement
(Box 3.1).

Technological innovations can reinforce
traditional biases associated with who
produces content, and who benefits from it
OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FACILITATE
AFFORDABLE, EFFICIENT AND MORE INCLUSIVE
CONTENT CREATION
Open educational resources (OER), a term coined by
UNESCO in 2002, have been defined as ‘learning, teaching
and research materials in any format and medium that
reside in the public domain or are under copyright that have
been released under an open licence, that permit no-cost
access, reuse, re-purpose, adaptation and redistribution by
others’ (UNESCO, 2019). OER are primarily associated with
online and digital educational technologies but can also
refer to printed materials (Butcher et al., 2023).
OER are based on five freedoms – to retain, reuse, revise,
remix and redistribute resources – which can contribute to
education in at least three ways (Miao et al., 2019; Wiley,
2014) (Box 3.2). The first is by improving the quantity
of relevant learning materials in a cost-effective way.
By re-using and repurposing resources, it is possible to
cut development time and avoid duplication of work.
The second is by improving the quality of the resources.
Open sharing of resources increases peer review and
fosters continuous improvement of materials. Finally,
OER can improve inclusion in education. The ability to
modify materials makes them more accessible to different
learners (Janssen et al., 2023). A practical example is
the Bloom Library, an open-source book production
platform that allows users to create their own books
using templates and Creative Commons images with a
user-friendly tool. The platform has over 11,000 books in
over 500 languages, including several minority languages,
which can be downloaded and shared, even without the
internet (Bloom Library, 2022).

B OX 3.1:

The open education movement: What is ‘open’?
The open education movement is founded on the principle of widening participation in education, and it has gained newfound relevance
and momentum thanks to the increasing availability and use of technology in education (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2020). It has numerous
applications, including open-source software development, open data, open pedagogy, open access to academic literature and open
educational resources (OER). This chapter focuses on access to learning materials and frames openness along two dimensions: access
and adaptation rights (Table 3.1).

Access rights refer to the existence of financial or non-financial restrictions. Locally shared learning materials within an institution, for
example, may allow members to freely use, adapt and share within the group, but these materials are only semi-open because access is
not available for everyone. Adaptation rights are linked to open licences, which allow users to use, adapt and share content
(Janssen et al., 2023).
Although this two-dimensional framework helps conceptualize the debate, it is not meant to be restrictive, nor to mean that only free
and adaptable materials are valuable. The debate must encompass all attempts to increase access and participation, even if they do not
achieve the highest levels of ‘openness’. Moreover, other important characteristics of openness are not explored in the framework. These
include, for example, technical openness – the use of open-source tools and platforms – and content requirements, including whether
they are accessible to people with disabilities (Janssen et al., 2023).

The cost of learning materials is a significant barrier to
accessing content. OER contribute to reduced spending
on learning materials by both students and institutions.
A 2018 study in the United States found that a shift to OER
in the state of North Dakota required an initial investment
of USD 110,000 and led to over USD 1,000,000 in savings
for students (Gallion, 2018). In Malaysia, an initiative
to replace textbooks and courseware with OER by the
Wawasan Open University led to estimated savings in the
cost of course development of MYR 1.4 million
(USD 300,000) within four years (Arumugam, 2016).
A study found that the production of printed versions of
OER science textbooks for secondary education could cost
less than half as much as traditional textbooks, even if
they were updated every year. Cost savings could be much

49

C H A P T E R 3 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess to content

higher if they were re-used for several years, as is the case
for traditional ones (Wiley et al., 2012).

The cost of learning materials is a significant
barrier to accessing content
Lower costs do not mean lower quality. Several studies
at the post-secondary level find that students using
OER perform as well as, or even better than, those
using their commercial equivalents (Allen et al., 2015;
Fischer et al., 2015; Jhangiani et al., 2018). A recent study
confirmed these findings at the primary education level.

B OX 3.2:

Creative Commons licenses have set the standard for OER
Open licensing is a necessary precondition for the development of open educational resources. It offers the necessary legal backing for
permissions regarding the use, reuse and sharing of the materials. Open licenses, which limit restrictions and give creators the choice of
which rights they give up are often called ‘copyleft’, in opposition to the usual law of ‘copyright’ (Miao et al., 2019).
The most commonly used open licenses globally, and in particular for open educational resources, are the Creative Commons (CC)
licenses, launched by a non-profit organization in 2002 (Green, 2018; Miao et al., 2019). CC licenses require that the original work be
attributed to creators who retain the copyright on their work, but they simplify restrictions and use. Although it is difficult to quantify the
number of works with Creative Commons licenses worldwide, it is estimated that it has grown from about 140 million in 2006 to at least
2 billion in 2020. There are four types of restrictions that combine to create six license options. The less restrictive licenses, which do not
carry the ‘No Derivative’ restriction, allow users to adapt and modify works, one of the central tenets of OER. In addition to open licenses,
there is also a public domain dedication for materials that are owned by the public and can be used by anyone without permission
(Butcher et al., 2023) (Figure 3.1).

No performance difference was found between grade
3 mathematics students in the United States who used
OER curriculum materials and those using commercial ones
(Hilton et al., 2019).
The potential of open resources to improve education has
been increasingly recognized. What started as projects
from individual institutions, such as MIT OpenCourseWare
launched by the Massachussets Institute of Technology
in 2001, has been mainstreamed in many educational
policies and strategies worldwide. For the past two

decades, UNESCO has led international efforts to drive
the OER movement, which have resulted in the Paris
OER Declaration in 2012, the Ljubljana OER Action Plan in
2017 and the UNESCO General Recommendation on OER
in 2019 (Janssen et al., 2023). In 2022, the Transforming
Education Summit, a high-level event convened by the UN
Secretary-General, stressed that OER are digital public
goods and a powerful solution for improving access and
quality in education (UNESCO, 2022).

Globally, awareness and positive attitudes toward OER
have been on the rise. Nevertheless, implementation
and use have grown more slowly. Surveys of mainly
tertiary-educated professionals working with teaching
and research in over 35 countries found that the
availability of OER policies and support for such policies
increased considerably between 2016 and 2021: 86% of
respondents stated that they were aware of OER 2021.
But only 45% were involved in some OER activity or
project (Commonwealth of Learning, 2022). This pattern
of increased awareness and demand, but low adoption is
confirmed by other surveys of higher education institutions
in Latin America, South and South-eastern Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa (Janssen et al., 2023).

initative began to support communities of tutors to
collaboratively develop open textbooks for primary and
secondary education in science and mathematics
(Janssen et al., 2023).

The COVID-19 pandemic has, in many instances,
accelerated OER adoption. In the United States, the use of
OER in higher education increased considerably and the
share of professors who believe ‘students learn better
from printed materials’ dropped from 43% in 2020 to 33% in
2022 (Janssen et al., 2023; Seaman and Seaman, 2022).
OER also played an important role in pandemic responses
in, for instance, Poland, Slovakia, and Shanghai, China
(Janssen et al., 2023).

Social media can act as an important source of educational
resources for both students and teachers. Teachers often
consider social media a more reliable and curated source of
updated practices and strategies than the internet because
of their user-generated content from fellow educators
(Greenhow et al., 2019; Trust et al., 2016). Social media
platforms can also foster collaborative content creation
by users. Academics have been engaging in new forms of
informal peer review and feedback exchanges. The trend,
termed ‘social scholarship’, has developed interdisciplinary
projects and crowdsourced syllabi (Greenhow et al.,
2019). Students can use social media to access content
from a trusted network. At Mzuzu University in Malawi,
for example, lecturers send voice notes to student
WhatsApp groups with explanations on a given topic and
to answer any questions or comments they may have
(Childs and Valeta, 2023).

COLLABORATIVE TOOLS CAN IMPROVE THE
DIVERSITY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT CREATION
Technology has radically increased opportunities to
develop content collaboratively. In 1995, the development
of wiki software, a product of the open software
movement, revolutionized content creation in the digital
age. The software allows documents to be directly edited
by anyone while keeping retrievable records of every
edit and every version (Rosenzweig, 2006). Its greatest
application, Wikipedia, has become the world’s largest
encyclopedia with over 55 million freely accessible articles
and the fourth most visited website worldwide (Statista,
2021; Wikipedia, 2022a) (Box 3.4). The wiki software is also
often used in schools and tertiary education institutions.
In Kerala state, India, for example, the SchoolWiki initiative
connects 15,000 schools for collaborative content
development (Telegraph, 2022).
Collaborative content creation is also strongly linked to the
OER movement, which supports constant improvements
to existing resources. In 2009, the government of the
Netherlands created the platform Wikiwijs, a nationwide
OER initiative, encouraging teachers from primary to
higher education to produce and share educational
resources based on open standards, so that others can
build on them. The platform had over 400,000 lessons and
6 million direct visits in 2022. In South Africa, the Siyavule

SOCIAL MEDIA IMPROVE ACCESS TO
USER-GENERATED CONTENT AND SHARING
Social media are online-based applications that allow users
to generate and share content and to engage in social
networking. Their widespread adoption began in 2004,
and within a few years, the number of studies analysing
their role in education had skyrocketed (Barrot, 2021;
Greenhow et al., 2019).

Among the most wide-reaching social media tools for
educational content creation and dissemination is YouTube.
Founded in 2005, it has become the largest video-sharing
platform and the second most visited website in the world
(Statista, 2021). Its wide reach, video format and ease of
use have turned it into a major player in both formal and
informal learning. According to a 2018 Google survey,
90% of Brazilian YouTube users reported using the platform
to learn or study (Marinho, 2018). In 2019, Brazilian
channels created by school teachers had over 5 million
views per month, with some teachers earning three
times the minimum statutory salary for teachers from
the platform alone (Cafardo, 2019). In the United States,
a survey of 14- to 23-year-olds found that nearly
60% of them ranked YouTube as their preferred learning
tool – above in-person activities, learning apps/games
and textbooks (Pearson, 2018). About 80% of the top
113 universities in the world, according to the Shanghai
ranking, use YouTube to share their videos (Acosta et al.,
2020). The COVID-19 pandemic increased the importance

DIGITIZATION SIMPLIFIES CONTENT
DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

Availability of digitized educational materials
helps systems overcome barriers associated
with distribution and storage
Several other national and regional initiatives have
encouraged digitization of content, with libraries,
museums and national archives playing an important
role (Collier, 2006). In 1997, the National Library of France
launched its digital library Gallica, which digitizes around
100,000 items per year. Between 2010 and 2014, Gallica
increased its digitized repository from 1 to 3 million
documents (Gallica, 2022). Other digitization projects aim
at preserving heritage. In India, the Panjab Digital Library
is a non-profit organization focused on digitizing material
related to the heritage, culture and language of Punjab
state (Panjab Digital Library, 2022). The National Digital
Library of Finland aims to preserve Finnish cultural and
scientific materials (UNESCO, 2016).
Overall, electronic books reduce production and
distribution costs. A survey of publishers in Ghana, Kenya
and Nigeria revealed that the production cost of a book
with an average print run of 500 copies is about

Digitization refers to the process of converting information
into a digital format, such as through scanning,
photographing or retyping (Hanna, 2022). Availability of
digitized educational materials helps systems overcome
barriers associated with distribution and storage. One of
the first mass digitization projects, Project Gutenberg,
was launched in 1971 as an entirely volunteer-run initiative
aimed at digitizing and distributing electronic books,
or e-books. Volunteers contribute digitized versions of
books regardless of format, language or topic, as long as
they are in the public domain or have copyright permission
(Hart, 2007). The project currently hosts over 60,000 free
e-books (Project Gutenberg, 2022). Another example is
the Million Book Project, also known as the Universal
Library Project – a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon
University and government and research partners in China
and India. Around the world, 50 scanning centres digitized
over 1.5 million books in over 20 languages (Universal
Digital Library, 2008).

of the platform. In Bangladesh, teachers uploaded videos
to YouTube and Facebook during the pandemic because it
was the easiest way to deliver content to students
(Mulla et al., 2023).

USD 2,500. In comparison, an e-book costs about
USD 40 to produce once the infrastructure is in place,
and can be reproduced an unlimited number of times;
the final cost represents a small fraction of the printed
publication process. Most publishers indicated that digital
production takes less than half the time needed for print
production (Brown and Heavner, 2018).
Nevertheless, growth in the market share of e-books
has been slower and smaller than many expected, even
taking into account the relatively high price of devices
needed to access digital books (Brown and Heavner, 2018;
Handley, 2019). E-books have not taken off even in rich
countries (Richter, 2021) (Figure 3.2). In the United States,
it is estimated that 30% had read an e-book by 2021,
still well below the 65% who have read a printed book.
Those who are richer and more educated are the most
likely to read an e-book rather than a printed book
(Faverio and Perrin, 2022).
Governments invest in digital textbooks while publishers
search for new business models
Despite significant upfront costs, including infrastructure
and training, digitization of textbooks can greatly reduce

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

52

3

the production and distribution unit cost (Brown and
Heavner, 2018; Lee et al., 2013). Digital textbooks also
have the advantage of increasing student access to
content outside school hours (Lindqvist, 2018). Moreover,
those openly licensed as OER encourage contextual
adaptations that can improve inclusiveness and
relevance (Janssen et al., 2023). However, this requires a
reconfiguration of some of the dominant business models.
As a starting point, many governments have been
digitizing content from traditional textbooks as static
digital versions – that are not interactive, for example –
with the objective of increasing their availability. In Bhutan,
all government textbooks are downloadable from the
Royal Education Council’s website, although most refer
to primary education. Textbooks used in secondary
education are often published by non-state actors and
are therefore not available digitally (Mulla et al., 2023).
In Nepal, textbooks have been digitized as PDF files that
are available for download (Mulla et al., 2023). The Rwanda
Education Board began digitizing all textbook content and
making it available on its e-learning platform (IITE and IIEP,
2021).
There are also moves away from static digital versions
towards digitally enhanced contents. In Algeria, concerns
over the heavy weight of textbooks led the government to
develop a digital version of primary school textbooks that
also contains supplementary materials such as videos,
animations and interactive features (Njoya, 2022). In India,
the government is embedding all textbooks with QR
codes to convert them into ‘energized textbooks’. When
scanned, the QR codes can provide additional information,
contextualize content and bridge the gap between home
and instructional languages (Agha, 2018; Mulla et al.,
2023). In Sweden, collaborative digital textbooks are
being developed for teachers and students to engage with
materials and experience a multimodal way of learning
(Kempe and Grönlund, 2019).
Digitizing textbooks can make them more accessible.
In India, the National Institute of Open Schooling has been
developing content in Indian Sign Language and Digitally
Accessible Information System-enabled talking books
(Mulla et al., 2022; NIOS, 2022). In Kenya, the Ministry of
Education partnered with eKitabu, a local company, to help
the deaf community and local content creators produce
visual storybooks and integrate sign language videos in
early grade readers (All Children Reading, 2018). eKitabu
is also developing 270 accessible e-books for Malawi,
220 in Tumbuka and 50 in Malawian Sign Language (All
Children Reading, 2020; Buningwire, 2022). In Paraguay,
the Ministry of Education and Science piloted the
Accessible Digital Textbooks for All initiative in 2021, which

53

C H A P T E R 3 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess to content

develops digital tools and content based on Universal
Design for Learning principles to make learning accessible
to students both with and without disabilities (UNICEF,
2022). Over 92 countries have ratified the 2013 Marrakech
Treaty, which requires parties to set exceptions to
copyright rules allowing the reproduction and distribution
of published works in accessible formats for people who
are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled
(WIPO, 2016, 2023).
Commercial publishers can be slow to adapt their
business models. Printed textbooks are very profitable.
For instance, e-books only represent about 10% to 13% of
publishers’ printed book revenue in Ghana, Kenya and
Nigeria, as they face challenges adapting, maintaining
and understanding new technologies. A lack of digital
infrastructure in schools and of government policies to
support sales of digital textbooks pose challenges for the
publishers to change their production modes (Brown and
Heavner, 2018). In Brazil, the 2015 National Programme
for Textbooks that distributes textbooks to public primary
and secondary schools allowed publishers to offer digital
textbooks. However, the government stipulated that digital
textbooks must have the same content as printed versions
in order to preserve fair competition between publishers,
many of which did not have the capacity to produce digital
content (FNDE, 2023).
Governments and commercial publishers must find
sustainable models for the changing textbook market.
In France, a non-profit association of mathematics
teachers founded Sésamath, an online platform to share
educational materials, including textbooks. The association
is financially supported by the government, but almost
90% of their operating costs are covered by partnerships
with publishers for low-cost printed textbooks – an
example of how governments, OER and commercial
publishers can approach the market together (Orr et al.,
2015; Sésamath, 2020).

Governments and commercial publishers
must find sustainable models for the changing
textbook market
Commercial publishers are more likely to move towards
digital books at the tertiary level, where they are less
dependent on government infrastructure and regulations.
Digital textbooks already make up a considerable share of
the higher education revenue of major publishers such as
Pearson and McGraw-Hill (Bouchrika, 2022). This move
requires a change in business models, however, that raises

B OX 3.3:

Digital technology is disrupting higher education
in various ways
Technology has been steadily changing the way higher
education operates. The transformation has only accelerated
with COVID-19 (Komljenovic, 2022). Identifying the channels
through which this transformation is most likely to occur
can help societies better understand the potential risks
and benefits, and how governance and regulations might
need to respond.
Three forms of disruptions are described. First, a digital
disruption ‘in’ higher education refers to institutions using
technology, such as digital platforms, to personalize or
increase the efficiency of their services. Second, a digital
disruption ‘of’ higher education corresponds to the expansion
of services through partnerships, such as the development of
university-associated MOOCs or online programmes. Third,
a digital disruption ‘to’ higher education refers to parallel
systems of teaching and learning that will challenge the role of
institutions. An example is Udemy, an online platform aiming
to create a learning marketplace, which connects instructors
and learners: anyone can upload videos and courses for
participants to follow for free or a fee (Magee, 2015).
In all three cases, the value of digital products is not based
on a commodity market or the usual transfer of ownership
from seller to buyer. Instead, it is based on an asset market,
where resources bring future value through maintaining
ownership and charging for access to the asset. This poses
new regulatory, ethical and political challenges. For instance,
student and personnel data create value, which is being shared
between institutions and technology companies. Students
and staff may be constrained in their choice of platforms and
the requirement to agree or not to their terms of use. In the
United States, universities have been signing subscription
deals with major publishers to provide all required digital
learning materials to students at a discount (Carrns, 2020).
This severely restricts students’ and professors’ choices and
may increase costs, as institutions get locked into exclusivity
contracts (del Valle, 2019). These digital disruptions must be
seen from the perspective of the overarching role of higher
education, which goes beyond the technical process of
transmitting skills.

several regulatory and ethical concerns (Box 3.3). In this
context, OER have been gaining ground as an accessible
solution to higher education learning materials. OpenStax,
a non-profit corporation, has been publishing openly
licensed college textbooks online for free that are used

in over 100 countries (OpenStax, 2022). Nevertheless,
despite a few exceptions, including Siyavula in South
Africa, open textbooks are still mostly restricted to North
America, where the affordability of learning materials is
high on the political agenda (del Valle, 2019; Hall, 2023;
Pitt et al., 2019)
DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL CONTENT
REPOSITORIES HELP LEARNERS DISCOVER MORE
CONTENT
The overwhelming amount of digital educational
resources has increased the need to develop mechanisms
to store but also to manage and organize resources
efficiently (Koutsomitropoulos et al., 2010). This includes
the development of standardized metadata that filter
learning materials and portals that help users search for
them (Atenas and Havemann, 2014; Currier et al., 2004).
Digital repositories or libraries, which took off in the early
1990s, have considerably improved information retrieval
(Collier, 2006).
The Ministry of Science and Higher Education launched
the National Academic Digital Library of Ethiopia
to help users find, access and download relevant
learning materials (National Academic Digital Library
of Ethiopia, 2020). In 2018, the National Digital Library
of India was launched as a one-stop search facility for
digital educational resources available in national and
international repositories. It collects digital content
metadata and allows users to filter their search by
education level, language, difficulty level and content
type (National Digital Library of India, 2022).
In Bangladesh, the government has developed the
Teachers’ Portal, a digital educational resources repository
for teaching and learning that allows teachers to exchange
their creations with over 600,000 registered users,
increasing their sense of self-efficacy despite challenges
faced accessing the portal (Hansson et al., 2018;
Mulla et al., 2023). The government has also created a
digital content repository for primary education that
contains textbooks with animated pictures, videos, audio
and diagrams, and an online repository of video-based
tutorials called Edu Hub (Mulla et al., 2023). In Nepal,
the government partnered with the Open Learning
Exchange organization to launch a learning portal that
provides free and open access to digital learning content
for all learners (Mulla et al., 2023). It contains thousands of
searchable, open-licensed books, audiobooks and videos in
10 languages (Butcher et al., 2023).

Libraries can also act as community hubs for OER
repositories. The International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions has an OER working
group. European libraries have been encouraged to work
together to develop their own OER policies. The African
Library and Information Associations and Institutions,
a non-governmental organization in Ghana, collaborates
with libraries and national library associations to promote
OER and knowledge production in the continent
(Butcher et al., 2023; Janssen et al., 2023). In 2022,
the Transforming Education Summit stressed the
importance of making OER accessible in findable,
accessible, interoperable and reusable OER repositories
(UNESCO, 2022).
More recent initiatives have aimed at improving the
searchability of material through machine learning
programmes that search digital content for keywords
that can be matched to curricula, although these are
still mostly in the early testing stages (Groeneveld et al.,
2022). The Learning Agency Lab, a non-profit organization,
has launched a competition to use artificial intelligence to
improve the matching of educational content to topics in
primary and secondary education (Learning Agency Lab,
2023).

Learning management systems have become
a multibillion dollar global business, valued at
USD 14.4 billion in 2021 and projected to grow
to USD 41 billion by 2029
LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS ARE A
KEY PART OF THE CONTEMPORARY LEARNING
ENVIRONMENT
A learning platform, also known as a learning management
system or course management system, is an integrated
set of resources, tools and online services for teachers
and learners within a course structure (UNESCO,
2011). It provides access to learning content, tests,
communication and collaboration tools, as well as course
management and assessment tools for instructors, thus
creating a virtual learning environment (Piotrowski, 2010).
Learning management systems have become a multibillion
dollar global business, valued at USD 14.4 billion in
2021 and projected to grow to USD 41 billion by 2029,
as it expands into the corporate training sector. Although
Northern America continues to hold the largest market
share, the strongest growth is expected in countries in
Asia and the Pacific, including Australia, China, India, Japan,

55

C H A P T E R 3 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess to content

Malaysia and Singapore (Fortune Business Insights, 2022).
Nevertheless, the most widely used learning platform
in the world, Moodle, is free and open source. Its use
ranges from schools, universities and informal learning
institutions to governments developing national public
learning platforms (Theocharis and Tsihrintzis, 2023).
The Transforming Education Summit identified the use
of ‘robust and open public digital learning platforms
and content, and digital learning resources treated as
global public and common goods’ as one of the key steps
towards harnessing the digital revolution for the benefit
of public education (United Nations, 2023). As a result of
the summit, UNESCO and UNICEF launched Gateways,
a multipartner initiative to improve access to quality
digital education content for everyone. The initiative
has three components: map publicly sanctioned digital
learning platforms and provide detailed information on
target users, quality control processes, accessibility,
breadth of content and openness; identify and share best
practices regarding the development of these platforms to
encourage peer learning within an international community
of practice; and build international consensus about norms
and quality standards for such platforms (UNESCO, 2023b).
Several successful examples of digital learning platforms
are already in place (Larson et al., 2023). In 2017,
the Indian government launched the Digital Infrastructure
for Knowledge Sharing, a national platform for school
education which has become the country’s largest
repository for digital educational content (Mulla et al.,
2023). It hosts energized textbooks, online courses,
content authoring/sourcing, interactive quizzes and
question banks. Its use increased considerably during the
COVID-19 pandemic and in July 2022, it was accessed over
50 million times per day (DIKSHA, 2021; Mulla et al., 2023).
In another example, UNICEF and Microsoft have launched
the Learning Passport in over 20 countries, a digital
platform that can serve as a national learning management
system or as a complement to existing learning platforms.
The pilot programme in Sierra Leone transformed 10 years
of paper examinations into digital assessments, allowing
students to take practice exams and receive feedback
(Carnelli et al., 2022). In Sudan, the Learning Passport
was launched by the Ministry of General Education
and the Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital
Transformation, in collaboration with UNICEF. The platform
includes material from the national curriculum for grades
1 to 8, such as digitized textbooks, interactive materials,
videos and assessments (UNICEF, 2021). In 2021, UNICEF,
UNESCO, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies,
and the EdTech Hub made recommendations for the

3

development of a Regional Learning Hub in eastern and
southern Africa, a learning platform whose content would
be aligned with national curricula (Groeneveld et al., 2022).
Governments have also developed offline mobile learning
platforms where access to electricity and internet is
low, but use of mobile phones is high. In 2017, in Kenya,
the government developed M-Shule, a mobile learning
platform that uses text messaging to provide students
with lesson plans, activities and learning materials.
It also uses the data collected from users to adapt and
send personalized content based on student needs.
The platform has reached over 20,000 households and has
been found to have an overall positive effect on student
learning and parental engagement (Myers et al., 2023; UIL,
2022). Shupavy291, a mobile educational platform used
in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Kenya, provides users with
curriculum-linked learning materials, sets up quizzes and
allows questions to be submitted through text message
(Myers et al., 2023). Finally, in Colombia, the government
developed Aprender Digital Ligera, a mobile version of
its learning platform, for regions with no or low internet
connectivity (Colombia Ministry of National Education,
2023).
It is common for social media applications to be used as
learning management systems in low-resource areas,
thanks to their ubiquity, mobile accessibility and user
friendliness (Cavus et al., 2021). Retrievable posts act
as information repositories and teachers can easily
disseminate course content to groups and conduct
summative assessments through individual message
exchanges (Tang and Hew, 2017). Facebook is considered
both an alternative to learning management systems
(Manca and Ranieri, 2016) and an effective complementary
tool alongside Moodle to improve student engagement
(Cavus et al., 2021). In Algeria, a survey of first-year
master's students found that Facebook surpassed
Moodle as the most used tool for education purposes
(Ghounane, 2020). In Egypt, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
professors were encouraged to use free platforms, such
as Google Classroom, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube,
to continue learning activities. Both faculty and students
preferred social media applications over education-specific
platforms like Google Classroom because of their higher
level of interactivity (Sobaih et al., 2020).

OPEN ACCESS RESOURCES HELP
OVERCOME VARIOUS BARRIERS
Technology has been used to expand access to distance
learning opportunities, notably in higher education through
open universities (Chapter 2). The link between technology
and digital course content has also led to the advent of

massive open online courses (MOOCs), which are available
for a large – or unlimited – number of participants and
can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection
(UNESCO and Commonwealth of Learning, 2016).
MOOCs took off in 2012 (Pappano, 2012). In 2020,
the COVID-19 pandemic led to a boost in enrolments.
The top three global MOOC providers – Coursera, edX and
FutureLearn – registered as many new users in April
2020 as they did in all of 2019 (Shah, 2020a). Smaller
MOOC providers also experienced fast growth. Edraak,
a non-profit Arabic MOOC platform, registered 1 million
new learners in 2020. Thailand’s official MOOC platform,
ThaiMOOC, received 286,000 new learners in 2020,
doubling its user base that year (Shah, 2020a). In 2021,
MOOCs had reached over 220 million learners worldwide in
over 190 countries (Coursera, 2021; Shah, 2021).
By removing most of the barriers associated with time,
location and cost, MOOCs promise to increase formal,
informal and lifelong learning opportunities. Although
MOOCs were originally developed as non-formal
learning tools, they have been increasingly used to
acquire full bachelor’s or master’s degrees (Kato et al.,
2020). In Indonesia, where low participation in tertiary
education is largely attributed to geographical challenges,
MOOCs can play an important role in expanding access to
post-secondary learning. In 1984, the government founded
the Universitas Terbuka, an open university, to provide
new forms of open and online learning, which today
includes MOOCs. Unlike the global trend, the majority of
MOOC users in Indonesia live in rural areas and are not
tertiary-educated, suggesting this mode of learning did
provide access to those who might otherwise have been
excluded (Belawati, 2019).
MOOCs are also viewed as beneficial to employers who
may value skills and professional knowledge more than
formal degrees (Gauthier, 2020). In Türkiye, the Bilgeiş
project was developed by the Middle East Technical
University and funded by the European Union and the
Turkish government as a portal for MOOCs specifically
designed to support professional development in a variety
of priority fields. It became one of the country’s biggest
MOOC providers, reaching over 90,000 learners within a
year (Cagiltay et al., 2019).
Digital educational content, including through MOOCs,
tends to be offered in dominant languages
(Janssen et al., 2023). Digital translation tools have
been freely available since the 1990s and can be used
to increase the reach of educational content (Groves
and Mundt, 2021). The European Union, for example,
has funded the TraMOOC project to provide machine

3

translation solutions specifically designed for content
available in MOOCs, including subtitles, slides,
assignments, quizzes and forum discussions (Behnke et al.,
2018). Commercial players have also been developing
education-specific translation services to increase access
to content. Microsoft Translator for Education, for example,
supports over 100 languages and is used to translate or
caption live presentations and improve the engagement of
non-native speaking students (Microsoft Translator, 2021).

By removing most of the barriers associated
with time, location and cost, MOOCs promise
to increase formal, informal and lifelong
learning opportunities

Translation tools help connect students and teachers
from various countries. A consortium of universities
in Canada, Colombia, India, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sudan and Thailand share core courses on global health.
Classes are streamed to students from all institutions,
who are expected to work together on assignments
using translation tools (Hill et al., 2022). Translation also
increases the accessibility of courses by helping non-native
students translate their essays and assignments into the
language of instruction, although this may lead to concerns
over academic integrity and quality (Groves and Mundt,
2021). Other tools have also been developed to improve
family engagement by translating communication between
parents who do not speak the language of instruction and
their child’s teachers (Lash, 2022; Microsoft Translator,
2021).

TECHNOLOGY USE TO INCREASE ACCESS
TO CONTENT FACES CHALLENGES
The exponential growth of digital educational content
from an increasingly diverse group of providers has led
to a proliferation of content aiming to fulfil very different
needs. This makes it harder to ensure minimum quality
standards. Policymakers and teachers who have previously
played a central role in quality assurance have expressed
concern that several initiatives to digitize content
and develop online education repositories have been
implemented without due diligence or planning, resulting
in an overwhelming amount of low-quality digital content
(Mulla et al., 2023).

57

C H A P T E R 3 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess to content

THE QUALITY OF DIGITAL CONTENT IS DIFFICULT TO
ASSESS AND TO CONTROL
The sheer quantity of digital resources poses logistical
challenges to evaluation, and governments often lack the
capacity to gather evidence regarding their usefulness.
The government of Bangladesh, for example, has defined a
lack of quality in available digital content as its motivation
for developing the Blended Education Ecosystem, a new
policy which tries to focus on issues of quality and equity
(Mulla et al., 2023).
The quality of individual MOOCs is also particularly
difficult to assess. Although they reach many learners,
few engage and even fewer complete them. Several
studies have estimated completion rates across a variety
of different MOOCs at below 5% (Ruipérez-Valiente et al.,
2019; Wenzheng et al., 2019). Completion rates, which
are often seen as proxies for quality in tertiary education,
are not comparable, given that not all learners have the
intention to complete MOOCs (Littlejohn et al., 2016).
Reasons for dropping out include lack of motivation or
desire to complete the course, lack of time and insufficient
prior knowledge (Itani et al., 2018; Zawacki-Richter et al.,
2018). Other reasons cited by learners shed light on the
institutional challenges of this mode of learning, including
feelings of isolation and lack of support
(Zawacki-Richter et al., 2018).
There are also concerns regarding difficulties in evaluating
student work at scale. In order to accommodate the
vast numbers of students, assessments tend to be
multiple-choice quizzes, which target lower-level factual
knowledge and provide weaker evidence of learning
(Yousef and Sumner, 2021). Moreover, there are numerous
concerns regarding plagiarism, cheating and verifying the
identity of test takers (Kolowich, 2013; Yousef and Sumner,
2021). By charging students for certificates that have little
value in terms of proving student learning, critics have
accused MOOCs of being high-tech versions of diploma
mills (Shea, 2015).
Another challenge to ensuring the quality of digital content
stems from its decentralized structure, which makes it
harder to keep checks on content producers. Concerns
are also raised over the fact that anyone can contribute
content to collaborative sites like Wikipedia, which has
experienced several incidents of vandalism (Cunneen and
O’Neil, 2021; Hern, 2021; Malone-Kircher, 2016). Still,
the long-standing success of the Wikipedia project helps
highlight how a decentralized structure may actually help
improve the quality of the content (Box 3.4).

3

B OX 3.4:

Wikipedia has used the power of collaborative content creation
Launched in 2001, Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can use and, most importantly, edit. Unlike most other reference
sources, its content is continuously created and updated collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers (Rosenzweig, 2006).
Paradoxically, although Wikipedia’s decentralized structure is the main source of concern regarding the reliability of its content, it is also
at the heart of the project’s strength. Popular articles are reviewed by thousands of people, a mass review system that can increase
reliability (Cunneen and O’Neil, 2021). Because there is only one page for a given topic, broad groups of people are encouraged to
transparently discuss and reach an agreement on what can or cannot be included, as opposed to other platforms where each person
might upload their own version of a given event (Feldman, 2018). Moreover, Wikipedia has no leaders, which means that it is harder for
individuals with power to get special treatment by appealing to a select few. The project has also developed numerous tools to prevent
vandalism, including a semi-protected status for high-profile pages and IP tracking and blocking if necessary (Cohen, 2021).
Altogether, these strategies appear to work. A growing number of studies have pointed to the generally high reliability of Wikipedia
articles. A study comparing Wikipedia with Encyclopædia Britannica found them to be of comparable accuracy (Giles, 2005). Other studies
point to a high degree of accuracy in a variety of topics, including political science, history, pharmacology and medicine, even if concerns
on readability and omissions remain (Azer et al., 2015; Kräenbring et al., 2014; Kupferberg, 2011; Rosenzweig, 2006). Wikipedia has
become the main tool for fact-checking other major platforms such as YouTube and Facebook (Flynn, 2017; Glaser, 2018). In 2020, the
World Health Organization partnered with the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit body which administers Wikipedia, to expand access
to reliable and up-to-date COVID-19 information (WHO, 2020).

Various strategies can help ensure minimum quality
standards
Several strategies aimed at improving the quality of digital
learning materials have been implemented. One is through
the development of quality assurance frameworks.
An example is the OpenupED quality label, applied to
MOOCs in the European OpenupEd partnership, which
was derived from the E-xcellence framework developed
by Association of Distance Teaching Universities.
OpenupED assesses institutional areas related to strategic
management, curriculum design and staff and student
support, as well as course components such as relevancy,
student engagement and learning assessments (UNESCO
and Commonwealth of Learning, 2016).
Other strategies opt for stronger government involvement
and clearer ties with the formal education system. Several
governments have been increasing their engagement with
MOOCs as a way to increase access to post-secondary
learning, while ensuring minimum standards (UNESCO
and Commonwealth of Learning, 2016). In 2017,
the Chinese government set quality criteria that allow
a MOOC to be nationally recognized, as well as annual
targets for the number of nationally recognized courses,
reaching 3,000 by 2020 (Schaffhauser, 2019). In France,
the Ministry of Higher Education launched the France
Université Numérique in 2013, a MOOC platform that
hosts courses from over 160 institutions, which reached
over 2.5 million learners in 2021 (FUN-MOOC, 2022).

The platform has strong data policy regulations, and offers
verified certificates to learners who are observed through
their webcams while taking exams online (Mongenet,
2016). In India, the National Education Policy 2020 allows
students to take 40% of their degree online via the official
MOOC platform Swayam, which was launched in 2017,
up from 20%. Offering courses from over 135 Indian
universities, the platform has the advantage of offering
academic credit for courses and has already reached over
10 million learners (Shah, 2020b).
Another strategy is the development of alternative
credentials. The European MOOC Consortium, coordinated
by the European Association of Distance Teaching
Universities, aims to increase the impact of MOOCs by
developing a common framework for the recognition of
micro-credentials in Europe (European MOOC Consortium,
2022). In 2021, over 1,600 micro-credential programmes
were offered from the main global MOOC providers (Shah,
2021). Ideally, micro-credentials would ensure minimum
standards have been met by both the institution and the
learner, though currently the vast majority of alternative
credentials still lack recognition and standardization
(Box 3.5).
Some platforms hope to ensure minimum quality
standards by recentralizing content production and
increasing partnerships with well-known institutions.
YouTube, for example, has been trying to control the quality

3

B OX 3.5:

Micro-credentials aim to recognize new forms of learning
Alternative credentials are being increasingly adopted for their flexibility in recognizing different forms of learning, and are directly
associated with the digitalization of education (Chakroun and Keevy, 2018; Oliver, 2022) (Focus 14.1). The most common of them, the
micro-credential, refers to ‘a record of focused learning achievement verifying what the learner knows, understands or can do’ that has
‘stand-alone value and may also contribute to or complement other micro-credentials or macro-credentials, including through recognition
of prior learning’ (Oliver, 2022, p. 6).
Countries and regional organizations have been trying to develop frameworks and standards for micro-credentials in order to link them
to minimum quality standards (Oliver, 2019). The European MOOC Consortium is working on a Common Micro-credential Framework
to be used on a voluntary basis by MOOC providers, with the aim of micro-credentials becoming convertible into formal qualifications
(European MOOC Consortium, 2019). Micro-credentials have also recently been included in the New Zealand Qualifications Framework
(Wheelahan and Moodie, 2021). In Malaysia, the Malaysian Qualifications Agency formally implemented accreditation strategies for
micro-credentials in higher education institutions in 2019 (Kumar et al., 2022). In the Netherlands and Norway, a 2021 consultation
by the European Commission has led to discussions on embedding micro-credentials into formal vocational education and training
(Cedefop, 2022).
Despite the potential, the impact of micro-credentials in both the labour market and higher education remains low (Cedefop, 2023).
Employers are unable to understand, judge or compare the different types of micro-credentials available, and are concerned by the
lack of quality assurance (Chakroun and Keevy, 2018). There is little standardization, even within the same micro-credential providers.
The platform Coursera, for example, offers micro-credentials that vary from USD 27 to USD 636 in fees, from 1 to 15 months in length,
and from 1 to 40 hours of reported effort a week (Pickard, 2018). There is also limited evidence of micro-credentials’ ability to increase
employment, advancement or earnings (Kato et al., 2020).
A specific type of digital credentials, the open badge, has been gaining ground as more learners engage with open content. The open
badge contains specific metadata that allow people to verify the badge and obtain information on the skills acquired. It is distinguished
by the fact that it is controlled by the badge earner instead of institutions, and that they must be issuable by, and shareable to, anyone
(Clements et al., 2020). Unlike micro-credentials that aim to keep a strong link to the formal sector, the main goal of open badges is to
recognize a wider range of forms of learning and give learners the possibility to customize the presentation of their skills (Blanc, 2019).

of videos by funnelling financing and resources to a few
more trusted providers. In 2018, YouTube announced a new
Learning Fund programme that will award USD 20 million
to educational content creators with verified expertise
and a minimum number of subscribers (Alexander, 2018).
The company has also been increasing partnerships
with well-established education institutions, such as
the Lemann Foundation in Brazil, to improve quality
control and therefore give advertisers safer channels for
advertisements (Castillo, 2018; Ducard, 2018; Fundação
Lemann, 2017).
TECHNOLOGY CAN REINFORCE GENDER, LANGUAGE
AND CULTURAL INEQUALITIES IN CONTENT
PRODUCTION
Although technology has decentralized content production
and removed some barriers to participation, content
is still mostly created by relatively privileged groups.
Wikipedia allows content creation by anyone with an
internet connection but has been widely criticized for a

59

C H A P T E R 3 • E quity and inclusion : A ccess to content

lack of diversity in its group of editors, mostly composed
of white men. In 2021, only 15% of global contributors
identified as women (Balch, 2019; Davis, 2021). A study
of individual educational content creators with at least
1,000 subscribers on YouTube in Spain found that 76% of
them were men. The gender gap is particularly pronounced
in science and social science, and opposite to what is found
among primary and secondary teachers in the country
(OECD, 2022; Pattier, 2021). More than just reflecting
existing inequality, technology may in fact exacerbate it.
In the Global South, one important challenge to
the implementation of OER is the localization (or
‘de-Westernization’) of content (Janssen et al., 2023;
Wimpenny et al., 2022). OER production and use is
still largely concentrated in the Global North. A global
consortium of institutions that collaborate on OER
development, Open Education Global, had 236 members
as of August 2022, of which 56% were from North America,
20% from Asia, 17% from Europe and only 7% from Africa,
Latin America and Oceania combined (Janssen et al., 2023).

3

A study of higher education repositories with OER
collections found that nearly 90% of them were created
either in Europe or in North America
(Santos-Hermosa et al., 2017). Of all the repositories in
OpenDOAR, one of the main OER repositories worldwide,
over 40% are from North America and Western Europe
(Dawson and Yang, 2016; OpenDOAR, 2022).
In addition, despite the goal of reuse and adaptation,
most of the OER works available worldwide are in English.
The OER Commons is a global library of over 50,000 openly
licensed resources in more than 100 languages, but 92% of
the material is in English, 2.5% in Spanish and about 1.5% in
French and Arabic (Janssen et al., 2023). OER remains
particularly poorly developed in Arabic-speaking countries,
with the exception of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. A literature
review and survey across 22 countries highlighted
poor infrastructure and lack of teacher motivation and
awareness of OER’s potential as some of the main
challenges. Another is a strong preference for Arabic
resources, which are not as available (Butcher et al., 2023;
Tlili et al., 2020).

Despite the goal of reuse and adaptation,
most of the OER works available worldwide
are in English

helps develop local OER through collaborative creation
in schools (TESSA, 2017). In Ghana, the Kwame Nkrumah
University of Science and Technology has developed a
national open access repository for health-related OER
(Janssen et al., 2023).
One example of a cross-national OER initiative is the
Virtual University for Small States of the Commonwealth.
This initiative provides infrastructure to develop and
use OER. The network of 32 countries in Africa, Asia and
the Pacific, and the Caribbean engage in collaborative
development and sharing of OER that is specifically
focused on sustainable development. It aims to maintain
the quality of resources by partnering with professionals
and specialists, and by providing capacity development for
OER producers (Janssen et al., 2023).
Several platforms help produce OER. An example is
StoryWeaver, a non-profit initiative by Pratham Books
in India that has become the largest global platform
for OER multilingual stories that promotes minority
languages. It has over 45,000 books in 323 languages,
over 60% of which are indigenous languages and 10% are
UNESCO-classified vulnerable or endangered languages.
The platform also provides translation tools and the
creation of bilingual storybooks in order to facilitate
content creation and use in the classroom (Butcher et al.,
2023).
Open access makes research free to read, but not to publish

Open licences and translation tools mean that content
can be easily translated, but two challenges remain. First,
finding relevant content is difficult when interfaces and
metadata are only available in a few languages (Amiel,
2013). Second, simply translating content is not enough
to make it contextually relevant (Butcher et al., 2023).
The fact that OER tends to be used in its original form,
as opposed to adapted and re-mixed, means that the
overwhelming dominance of English materials may end up
reinforcing cultural biases and the traditional philanthropic
education model of donating resources produced in
high-income countries. This model may hinder the creation
of locally produced, contextually relevant content
(Butcher et al., 2023; Hoosen and Butcher, 2019).
Still, several initiatives focus on locally producing OER.
The Teacher Education in sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA)
initiative, started in 2005, provides a bank of OER in
English, Kiswahili, French and Arabic to support teacher
education. One million pre-service or in-service teachers
have used TESSA OER through partner institutions in the
region, especially the Open Universities in Nigeria,
South Africa and Sudan (Janssen et al., 2023). TESSA also

The move towards open access to research may also
reinforce biases of who gets published. There are currently
two main paths towards open access: The ‘green’ open
access when authors self-archive a copy of their article in
a freely accessible repository and the ‘gold’ open access,
which requires authors to publish their article in an open
access journal (Tennant et al., 2016). Some 30% of articles
registered in the Directory of Open Access Journals
charge an article processing fee to authors (Directory
of Open Access Journals, 2022). Fees can reach over
USD 10,000 per article and are charged by major
publishers such as Springer Nature, Elsevier and
Taylor & Francis, restricting access from poorly funded
authors or institutions (Johnson, 2019; Mehta, 2019;
University of Cambridge, 2020).
In 2018, 11 European research funders, responsible for
nearly USD 9 billion in scientific research grants annually,
announced that any scientist they fund must make
their results freely available immediately on publication
(Else, 2018). The plan has been praised for its radical
shift towards increasing access to scientific knowledge,
but critics argue that its assumed preference for ‘gold’

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

60

3

open access, and its accompanying fee structure,
effectively changes the business model from ‘pay to read’
to ‘pay to publish’, thus perpetuating inequality (Johnson,
2019). That same year, the Latin American Council of Social
Sciences and Redalyc, a bibliographic database and digital
library of open access journals, launched a cooperative
infrastructure called AmeliCA, with UNESCO support,
to fight against the ‘pay to publish’ model (Aguado-López
and Becerril-Garcia, 2019). They advocate instead for a
scholar-led, non-profit system of scholarly communication,
common in Latin America.
Latin America is known for the ‘diamond’ open access
model, where open access journals do not charge any
fees and are financed instead mostly by governments
and academic institutions. A number of non-commercial
publishing platforms have successfully emerged in the
region, the first of which, Scielo, was launched in Brazil
in 1997 and is considered one of the first open access
collections in the world (Aguado-López and Becerril-Garcia,
2019; Tennant et al., 2016). A recent study shows that
Latin America has more ‘diamond’ open access journals
than Western Europe and Northern America combined,
and that these journals make up 95% of all open access
journals in this region. In comparison, ‘diamond’ journals
make up only 55% of open access journals in Western
Europe and 63% in Northern America (Bosman et al., 2021).
Research indexes can be another source of inequity
in publishing. They are responsible for measuring the
impact of each journal and have become gatekeepers
to what is considered legitimate research. In addition to
being accused of bias in favour of commercially published
journals, they require journals to systematically publish
English abstracts as well as a given percentage of English
articles (some require that over half be in English),
effectively contributing to global inequality in content
production (Aguado-López and Becerril-Garcia, 2019;
Bosman et al., 2021). The bias in favour of English can
be observed in the number of open access journals that
accept English submissions, sometimes exclusively, even
in non-English speaking countries around the world
(Figure 3.3).

TECHNOLOGY INCREASES ACCESS
MOSTLY FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY
HAVE IT
Access to digital content presupposes access to the
internet, or at least to computers or mobile devices.
However, even among those who have the infrastructure
to access digital educational content, those most likely
to do so continue to be the most privileged groups,
reflecting existing education and skills inequalities. Users
from rich countries are considerably overrepresented in

the use of open access resources online. High-income
countries account for about one quarter of global internet
users, but nearly 70% of the traffic to Wikimedia projects
(Figure 3.4). The Sci-Hub website, a shadow library that
bypasses journal paywalls, was developed with the
stated aim of helping poorer researchers from developing
countries access scientific literature, yet less than 10% of
downloads come from low- and lower-middle-income
countries combined, even if the countries represent over
35% of global internet users (ITU, 2022; Sci-Hub, 2022).

3

High-income countries account for about one

Data on MOOCs suggest similar findings. Learners from
richer countries are not only more likely to participate but
also to complete the courses and gain new competencies.
A study of over 120 courses offered between 2013 and
2018 by edX, a major MOOC provider founded by Harvard
and MIT, found that learners from high-income countries
are more likely than their peers in low- and middle-income
countries to complete the courses and to improve their
competencies, as measured by course assessments
(Karp Gershon, 2021). In 2018, 56% of enrolments and
69% of certifications in the edX platform came from
learners whose home country has a very high Human
Development Index (Ruipérez-Valiente et al., 2019).
Even within countries, MOOCs cater to the most
advantaged individuals. Numerous studies have
highlighted that some 80% of learners in the major MOOC
platforms already have a tertiary degree (Dillahunt et al.,
2014; Meaney, 2018; Oudeweetering and Agirdag, 2018;
Robinson et al., 2015). The typical MOOC learner is a
professional searching for extra training who already has
at least one post-secondary qualification (Oliver, 2022).
Several reasons help explain this bias in favour of learners
from high socioeconomic backgrounds. Language is a
major barrier to accessing MOOCs, as well as a lack of
digital skills and access to the internet. English is the
language of one quarter of internet users worldwide,
but is the overwhelming language of instruction for
MOOCs, particularly those with global or regional reach
(Agudo, 2019; Belawati, 2019; Statista, 2022b). As well as
difficulties following lectures, non-native English speakers
may feel uncomfortable participating in discussion forums,
which have been found to improve student engagement,
completion and grades (Wang et al., 2015).

MOOCs may also exacerbate existing inequality by design.
A focus on information transfer from lecturers to students
and on marked assignments, for example, is likely to favour
students who have experience in tertiary institutions.
Moreover, because these users are highly educated,
courses become increasingly designed for them (Meaney,
2018). Course design has a strong influence on the
probability of learners from poorer countries completing
a massive open online course (Sa’ar et al., 2021). Several
universities in sub-Saharan Africa are hesitant to
promote the large global MOOC providers because of
incompatibilities in pedagogy and epistemology (Childs and
Valeta, 2023).
National and regionally developed MOOC platforms are
helping to bridge some of these gaps. Multilingual and
non-English MOOCs have been successful at engaging
more diverse regional learners with lower levels of
education (Lambert, 2020). A study of the Arabic platform
Edraak found that it is more effective at reaching
Arabic-speaking, less educated and female learners
compared to global MOOCs (Ruipérez-Valiente et al., 2019).
A study of 15 different MOOC providers from 9 countries
covering over 8 million learners found that regional
providers are better at attracting a larger local population
with a more inclusive profile by offering courses that are
better catered to local needs, in local languages, and from
institutions they already know (Ruipérez-Valiente et al.,
2022). Still, critics argue that many of these local platforms
continue to reproduce other inequalities, such as relying
on video-centric content that requires a good internet
connection, and teacher-centred learning and assessment
(Bali and Aboulmagd, 2019).

CONCLUSION
Technology has the power to significantly improve access
to content and, in many instances, it already has. Open
educational resources help make content creation more
affordable, efficient and inclusive. Collaborative tools and
social media diversify production and can help with quality
control. Digital libraries and repositories improve storage
and distribution channels, and learning management
platforms help organize the contemporary learning
environment. Moreover, technology can remove many
of the common barriers for accessing content, including
language, cost and entry requirements.
Still, ensuring the quality and relevance of an
overwhelming amount of digital educational content
from decentralized producers is difficult. Governments
have implemented several strategies to ensure minimum
standards, including the development of quality assurance
frameworks, alternative credentials, and recentralizing
content production. However, they must also ensure that
digital educational content strengthens national education
systems, aligns with curricula and learning objectives and
provides appropriate lifelong learning opportunities.

Governments must ensure that digital
educational content strengthens national
education systems and aligns with curricula
and learning objectives
Governments must also guarantee that technological
advances do not leave learners further behind.
The development of digital public goods and the use of
free and open education resources are important steps in
that direction. Making content production more inclusive is
another. The supremacy of English and the main European
languages and the need to ‘de-Westernize’ educational
materials still pose significant barriers towards
accessibility and use of digital content worldwide. Inclusive
education resources should be available in different
languages, adapted to different contexts and realities,
and accessible by all learners.

KE Y MESSAGES
Technology can facilitate teaching and learning processes but requires contextualization and integrated support.
Technology offers many potential benefits for teaching and learning but the evidence has major limitations.


Systematic reviews of the past two decades find a small to medium positive effect of education technology on
learning outcomes.



But evaluations of what works are limited in geographical, subject and durational scope, and can often obscure the
role of various pedagogical factors in influencing outcomes.



Technology companies can have disproportionate influence. Pearson funded its own studies, contesting
independent analysis showing no impact.

Technology does not need to be advanced to have an impact; it needs to be context specific.


Pre-recorded lessons can reduce urban–rural teaching quality divides. In China, high-quality lesson recordings
were delivered to 100 million rural students, improving student outcomes by 32% and reducing urban–rural
earning gaps by 38%.



Devices with pre-loaded content need contextualization and integration support. In Peru, the One Laptop Per Child
programme distributed over 1 million laptops without any positive impact on learning.

Technology can improve instruction quality by adding time and personalization.


Personalization software can monitor student progress and provide differentiated practice opportunities and
feedback. Evaluations of the Ei Mindspark software in India documented learning gains in after-school settings and
for low-performing students.

Digital technology improves student engagement, with appropriate pedagogical integration.


Digital game-based applications improved cognitive and behavioural outcomes in primary and secondary
mathematics in 43 studies published in 2008–19.



Interactive whiteboards can potentially support the visual, auditory and tactile experiences of teaching and
learning if well integrated. But in the United Kingdom, large-scale adoption was limited to uses such as blackboard
replacement.



Augmented and virtual reality technology can supplement practical training in science and vocational lessons.

Digital technology can facilitate regular parental communication to support children’s learning.


Sending caregivers regular nudges can positively influence learning outcomes. During COVID-19, Botswana’s
education ministry provided parents with over-the-phone tutoring for numeracy concepts, leading to learning
outcome improvements.

ICT use carries a risk of increasing distraction and lowering student engagement.

67



Technology use beyond a moderate threshold was associated with diminishing academic gains in an analysis of
2018 Programme for International Student Assessment data.



A meta-analysis of research in 2008–17 across 14 countries found a negative effect of mobile phones on
academic performance.



COVID-19 online learning adversely affected younger learners. In Switzerland, secondary school children sustained
their learning progress better than primary schoolgoers in online learning.

ecause digital technology impacts so many aspects
of daily life, it is a reasonable assumption that its
application in the classroom will automatically transform
and improve teaching and learning. However, while
students need to be taught about digital technology,
as part of what is called 'digital literacy' (Chapter 5), this
does not necessarily mean that students need to be taught
through digital technology. The value of digital technology
for teaching and learning needs to be proven. The ways
in which technology has been used over time to support
teaching and learning continue to evolve, alongside a
better understanding of how technology should be used.
This chapter focuses on how technology is being used
to support teaching and learning. First, it presents
the potential of and challenges posed by technology
integration and describes key trends in technology use.
Second, it reviews the evidence on the possible benefits
of digital technologies for improving education quality,
grouping them into two broad categories: those that
directly focus on improving the quality of instruction,
by distributing resources more equitably, personalizing
and increasing practice opportunities; and those that seek
to better engage learners.

While students need to be taught about digital
technology, this does not mean that students
need to be taught through digital technology

TECHNOLOGY’S POTENTIAL FOR
TEACHING NEEDS TO BE SHOWN
IN PRACTICE
Views about how people learn have evolved considerably
over the past 100 years. The earliest theories, known
as behaviourism, saw learning as a process of receiving
and accumulating knowledge in a programmed manner.
The emphasis gradually shifted. Some theories, notably
constructivism, recognized that individual learners
‘construct’ their knowledge through inquiry and
experimentation. Others complemented this view with a
sociocultural perspective, which recognizes that learning
is enhanced through collaboration and support. In the
digital era, a newer approach, described as connectivism,
has drawn attention to the importance of learning through
forming connections around information (Selwyn, 2022).
Each theory helps explain the opportunities and limits of
technology to mediate various kinds of learning.
There are two broad types of possibilities that
technology offers for teaching and learning. First,
technologies can improve the quality of instruction by
redistributing resources, increasing chances to practise,
supplementing instructional time and personalizing
instruction (Escueta et al., 2020; Ganimian et al., 2020;
Major et al., 2021). Second, technologies can engage and
support learners by varying how content is represented,
stimulating interaction and prompting collaboration
(Figure 4.1).

Selwyn (2022); Topping et al. (2022).

Technology used in various combinations can achieve
multiple objectives. Data and learning analytics can guide
and customize learning experiences, whether they simply
respond to learners or actively try to guide them adaptively
(Bulger, 2016). Feedback can be more immediate and more
accurate. Personalized tools can propose tailored content
and activities (OECD, 2019). Students could spend less time
in face-to-face and whole classroom instruction. Hybrid
models of in-person and remote education could provide
learners with materials to work from wherever they are,
whenever they can. Self-paced and supplemented learning
could help struggling learners (Duraiappah et al., 2021),
even though information and communication technology
(ICT) can distract learners and be used for leisure instead
of study. Teachers can develop lessons for students to
learn at their own pace through personalized and adaptive
software, freeing up time for them to coach individual
students or work with small groups (Bulman and Fairlie,
2016; Reich, 2020). Technology can be used to help
prepare and deliver engaging lessons through such
tools as interactive whiteboards in smart classrooms,
simulations and collaborative learning. Cognitive load,
i.e. how much information can be held in the working
memory at the same time, can be reduced and student
motivation increased if materials are presented using
multimedia or digital games (Jamshidifarsani et al., 2019).
In high-income countries, some teachers report that
technology-based tools improve learning. According to
the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy
Study (ICILS), 87% of teachers in 12 participating education
systems thought that ICT helped students work at a
level appropriate to their learning needs and 78% that ICT

69

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

enabled students to collaborate more effectively
(Fraillon et al., 2019). In the United States,
a 2019/20 survey found that about a third of public
school representatives strongly agreed that technology
use in the classroom helped students learn more in an
independent and self-directed way, at their own pace,
and collaboratively with peers. About half stated that
teachers used technology to a moderate or large extent
for classroom work that would not have been possible
without it (Gray and Lewis, 2021). In Australia, a teacher
survey of technology use in mathematics classrooms
highlighted easier visualizations of mathematical concepts
and student opportunities to work at their own pace and
academic ability level (Attard and Holmes, 2022).
However, the fact that technology has the potential to
support education systems does not necessarily mean that
teaching processes and practices have been substantially
transformed (Reich, 2020). Some who promote technology
use in classrooms are accused of seeing technology as
a solution to every education problem. But technology
may not be the right approach to address contextual and
systemic challenges that prevent learners from acquiring
basic skills. Altering pedagogical practices in fundamental
ways exerts pressure on teachers, staff, students, parents
and caregivers who may be unprepared to deal with
them or may disagree with the consequences. And far
from being learner-centred, technology may promote a
highly individualistic approach to gaining knowledge that
undermines the collaboration and civic engagement that
are needed in public institutions (Selwyn, 2022).
Embedding technology into learning processes has risks
of its own. It can narrow learning priorities to those
areas served best by the most marketed and accessible
technological products. A large review of research focusing
on the effectiveness of online and blended learning in
schools found that many studies failed to report on all
pedagogical elements, suggesting authors were ‘digital
enthusiasts who were less enthusiastic about pedagogy’
(Topping et al., 2022). Moreover, the content of learning
applications may not be focused on learning objectives.
In the United Kingdom, a quarter of all commercial
applications labelled as educational on the Google Play
Store (Kanders et al., 2022) and the same share of the
most popular mathematics applications in both the Apple
and Google Play Stores (Outhwaite et al., 2022a) did not
include any explicit learning content.

4

Technology companies can have disproportionate
influence. With tremendous incentives to show
effectiveness, they may present only evidence that
supports them. While independent evaluations of
Successmaker, a reading and mathematics instruction
tool, found negative or null effects on learning in the
United States, Pearson – the company that developed
the product – continues to publicize self-funded
findings and conclusions of significant, positive
effects (Mathewson and Butrymowicz, 2020).

Technology companies may present only
evidence that supports them
Key commercial actors act as both salespeople and
advisors at the same time. Analysis of the networks and
channels of influence in technology in Norway showed
a direct link between industry, through the New Media
Consortium, an international community of education
technology actors, and the government, through the
Centre for ICT in Education under the authority of the
Ministry of Education and Research (Haugsbakk, 2021).
In the Netherlands, international actors have become
increasingly important in education technology. Google
has an estimated 70% market share in primary education
technology (Kerssens and van Dijck, 2021). Intel is
implementing artificial intelligence (AI) curricula in India
for 22,000 schools with the Central Board for Secondary
Education; in Poland, where the national AI curriculum
is based on Intel’s AI for Youth programme; and in the
Republic of Korea, where the Ministry of Education has
signed a memorandum of understanding to also scale
AI for Youth (Intel Corporation, 2022).

TECHNOLOGY IS NOT USED VERY
EXTENSIVELY FOR TEACHING
AND LEARNING
Learning achievement surveys show that the prevalence
of ICT usage in classrooms is not particularly high,
even in the world’s richest countries. According to the
2018 Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA), only about 10% of 15-year-old students in over
50 participating education systems used digital devices on
average for more than one hour per week in mathematics
and science lessons. Denmark was an outlier as the only
country where more than half of students reported such
use in both subjects. The next highest were Australia and
Sweden (Figure 4.1a), with about one in three students in
both countries reporting such use in science, but less in
mathematics. The survey also collected information on

the frequency with which students use digital devices at
school for different purposes. For instance, just over one
third of 15-year-olds reported using such devices at least
once or twice per week for drills and practice.
According to the 2019 Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), fewer than
one in four students on average attended schools where
science teachers carried out computer activities at least
once or twice a week. The average prevalence did not
increase between grades 4 and 8. More than two in three
students were in schools that included computer activities
in grade 8 science classes in Australia, New Zealand and
the United States. By contrast, fewer than 5% of students
attended such schools in Cyprus and France
(Mullis et al., 2020) (Figure 4.1b).
The 2018 ICILS showed that considerable ICT resources
were available in the 12 participating education systems,
all but one from high-income countries. About 60% of
grade 8 students – but 83% in Uruguay and over 90% in
Denmark and Finland – studied in schools whose ICT
coordinators reported there were practice programmes or
applications. Single- or multi-user games were available to
5 in 10 and 3 in 10 students, respectively. Simulation and
modelling software for classroom use were available for
42% of students, but this number ranged from 8% in Italy
to 91% in Finland (Fraillon et al., 2019) (Figure 4.2).
Academic and market research sources provide
complementary evidence on the characteristics of
education technology products while not always clearly
distinguishing whether they are also being used in
classrooms. A global mapping of over 300 education
technology products found that two thirds of them
focused on student-led self-learning, lesson delivery and
lesson preparation (Central Square Foundation, 2021).
Analysis in Pakistan looked at 48 digital learning tools
from 17 organizations, the fastest growing of which were
active in profitable areas, such as examination preparation
(Zubairi et al., 2022). An in-depth mapping of 50 digital
learning platforms and tools in Latin America found that
14 tools used personalization to adapt to student learning
levels, 12 used AI or machine learning, and 21 used
gamification or play-based learning (Myers et al., 2022).
Finally, a review of 40 out of over 1,000 personalized
learning solutions in low- and middle-income countries
categorized them by education purpose and setting.
It found that almost two thirds were designed for
supplemental learning only, offering multiple content,
practice exercises, assessments and games, while
three quarters could be used both in school and at
home (UNICEF, 2022).

Some governments ambitiously aim for comprehensive
integration of ICT in teaching and learning while others
may prioritize, for example, personalization of learning,
learning resource quality improvement and classroom
infrastructure. In Estonia, the government began using ICT
for school connectivity and teacher support reforms in the
1990s. Subsequently, curricula required the integration
of digital technology in all subjects, signalling a move to
digital culture integration in the Digital Turn Programme
2015–2018 and the Estonian Lifelong Learning Strategy
2020 (Pata et al., 2022).
A 2018 review of education policy in the United States
found that 39 out of 50 states had adopted policies to
deliver personalized learning opportunities, allowing
preschools and schools to define what personalization
means and how to implement it. Responding to the Every
Student Succeeds Act, which was signed in 2015, 17 states
incorporated personalized learning into their policies, while

19 states aimed to ensure all students had a personalized
learning plan aligned to their academic needs, interests
and goals (Zhang et al., 2020).
In India, the National Education Policy 2020 highlighted
the need for technological interventions to improve
instruction, learning and teacher professional
development (India Ministry of Education, 2020).
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, in states such as Uttar
Pradesh, there have been initiatives to use education
technology products on a large scale to support
improvements to foundational literacy and numeracy
(Agrawal, 2023). Haryana became the first state to scale
up personalized adaptive learning, selecting an education
technology partner to provide relevant software and
content on 500,000 tablets distributed to public school
students (Press Trust of India, 2023).

Few countries are integrating AI in their education
systems. Analysis of 24 national strategies launched
between 2016 and 2020 found that while most discussed
how to use education to develop expertise in this field,
only one third highlighted integration of AI into teaching
and learning. India and Kenya aspired to integrate AI to
improve quality, while Malta and Spain viewed AI more
as a complement to education to free up teacher time
(Schiff, 2022). Another global survey found that only 11 of
51 countries had developed and implemented AI curricula
(UNESCO, 2022).

Few countries are integrating artificial
intelligence in their education systems

Another major initiative is resourcing ‘smart’ classrooms,
expanding digital infrastructure and enhancing
interactivity through multimedia modes. China launched
Smart Education Pilot Zones in 2019 to pursue various
objectives for demonstration purposes, including using
AI and big data to assess student learning and offering
personalized services for teachers and students
(IITE et al., 2022). In Guyana, the 2021 ICT in education
policy and master plan aimed to provide computer labs and
smart classrooms in primary and secondary schools.
More resources are being allocated through the Support
for Educational Recovery and Transformation Project
for interactive screens and projectors in grades 2 to 6
(Guyana Ministry of Education, 2021:2022). In Rwanda,
between 2016 and 2021, about half of the secondary
schools were covered by the Smart Classroom initiative,
equipping them with laptops connected to the internet
as well as a projector (Resilient Digital Africa, 2021).

EVIDENCE ON TECHNOLOGY’S IMPACT
ON LEARNING IS MIXED
Evidence on how technology interventions affect
learning should inform the adoption and scaling up
of technology use in education settings. Systematic,
comprehensive reviews over the past two decades on
the effects of the use of technology on learning generally
find small to medium positive effects on learning outcomes
compared to traditional instruction (Cheung and Slavin,
2013; Lewin et al., 2019; Topping et al., 2022). For
instance, three recent meta-analyses, which reviewed
a total of 272 studies at various education levels and
in various countries, found an average positive impact
of medium size (Chauhan, 2017; Hillmayr et al., 2020;
Kärchner et al., 2022).
However, evaluations sometimes lack a control
group. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of
technology use compared to the same setting with a
different medium of teaching or learning, and to attribute
any positive effects to technology rather than other
factors, such as added instruction, more resources
or additional teacher support (Mayer et al., 2019).
Moreover, research varies widely in terms of the
duration of interventions, technology scope, education
levels covered, contexts and samples. For instance,
the duration of interventions affects the size of effects:
some meta-analyses that investigated the effects of
digital tools on learning have found that the longer the
intervention, the smaller the impact (Hillmayr et al., 2020;
Sung et al., 2016). As syntheses of existing evidence
may obscure the mechanisms of impact, it is important
to separately examine evaluations of individual types of
technology-based learning interventions.

PRE-RECORDED OR BROADCAST LESSONS
CAN SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED LEARNERS
Pre-recorded lessons are available in various
formats – audio, television, tablets, desktop computers,
laptops – to reduce gaps in access and learning (Chapter 2).
Transmitting live lectures directly to the classroom or using
recordings can help teachers focus their time and efforts
on integrating the lessons covered in the lectures rather
than on preparing content. In India, technology-aided
satellite teaching replaced one third of classroom teaching
in more than 1,800 rural government secondary schools,
resulting in improved mathematics and science scores
(Naik et al., 2020). Introduced in 2004, the Modern
Distance Education Program in Rural China policy is
considered the largest education technology intervention
ever implemented (Box 4.1). Analysis of a similar but
smaller scale programme with computer-assisted teaching
in China, conducted with 25 mathematics teachers and
almost 2,000 students, found that it had improved lower
secondary student performance. One third of the effect
was attributed to improved instructional quality of local
teachers who used lecture videos in lesson preparation
(Li et al., 2023).
Various conditions need to be fulfilled for such
interventions to succeed. It is not enough to just deliver
materials without contextualizing them and providing
support (Box 4.2). Teachers need to be integrated into
these efforts. Randomized controlled trials of the
e-Learn Project in Punjab province, Pakistan, evaluated
two models of tablet integration. The first provided
students with tablets preloaded with learning content and

video explanations while the second provided teachers
with the tablets to use for classroom teaching and to
guide students. Compared to control groups, student
achievement, as measured by mathematics and science
test scores, decreased in the first model and improved
in the second (Beg et al. 2019). ProFuturo, a large-scale
technology-assisted learning programme implemented
in Latin American, Asian and African countries, assists
over 400,000 primary school teachers with tablets or
computers preloaded with core educational content.
An impact evaluation of the programme in Luanda,
Angola, found that it had improved active teaching time
and drill and practice exercises, which in turn improved
student learning (Cardim et al., 2023).
Attributing effects to technology can be difficult for
programmes with multiple components. For example,
in Ghana, an intervention provided live, interactive
satellite-transmitted lessons from Accra to 70 remote
primary schools. The intervention included multiple
components: a highly qualified teacher who provided
the lecture over the broadcast, an additional teacher in
the classroom, teacher training and sustained support,
monetary incentives for teachers and for replacement
teachers to tackle absenteeism, and shifting the curricular
focus to basic building blocks to target teaching at the
appropriate level. After two years, there was a gain in
numeracy and literacy to which multiple factors beyond
broadcasting contributed: local facilitators were more
likely to be present, to teach in local languages and to
target populations in need of remedial support
(Johnston and Ksoll, 2022).

B OX 4.1:

Connecting urban with rural teachers helped improve student outcomes in China
A 2004 reform connected high-quality teachers in urban areas with more than 100 million students in rural primary and lower secondary
schools in China. Over four years, the programme provided 264,000 satellite-receiving sets and 440,000 DVD player sets, while it built
almost 41,000 computer rooms in rural schools. The interventions varied by school size: small primary schools received only DVD player
sets, primary schools received DVD player sets and satellite sets, and lower secondary schools received all three interventions. Lectures
and other study materials were then distributed to these rural schools.
The Ministry of Education selected the most accomplished teachers to record lectures and supporting materials such as interactive
quizzes. Once these lectures were broadcast, local teachers helped solve technical issues and ensured that students focused on classrelated activities. The objective was for the lectures to be integrated and not viewed as a separate teaching aid. Teachers delivered
the lecture at a slow pace, repeating difficult content several times. The Ministry regularly reviewed and updated these lectures, using
student and teacher feedback.
An impact evaluation between 7 and 10 years after the start of the intervention showed that it had increased Chinese and mathematics
skills by 32% among lower secondary school students. In the longer term, students exposed to the intervention were more likely to be
employed in occupations that focused on cognitive skills instead of manual skills. Exposure to the programme also led to an 18% reduction
in the education attainment gap and a 38% reduction in the earning gap between urban and rural areas (Bianchi et al., 2022).

It is not enough to just deliver materials
without contextualizing them and providing
support. Teachers need to be involved.

COMPUTER-ASSISTED SOFTWARE AND
APPLICATIONS SUPPORT DRILL AND PRACTICE
Teachers in the United States have used drill and practice
software extensively since the mid-1980s to help students
master concepts. Meta-analyses showed that drill and
practice applications that reinforced traditional instruction
were more effective than tutorial applications that
substituted for human instruction (Carnoy, 2004). Drill and
practice applications include digital flashcard activities,
in which students respond and receive feedback from the
programme, and branching drills, where each question is
determined by whether the previous one was answered
correctly (Kuiper and de Pater-Sneep, 2014). An in-depth
review of design elements of 23 mathematics applications
used by children in the first three years of school in Brazil,
Canada, China, Malawi, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates,
the United Kingdom and the United States showed that
targeted practice was the most common objective. Most
applications targeted basic number skills while more
advanced mathematics skills, such as fractions, were less
frequently included (Outhwaite et al., 2022b).
Practice-based educational applications have been
developed by the non-profit organization onebillion
to improve foundational learning in seven countries.
In Malawi, an e-learning platform for government primary
schools was loaded with the applications, which included
over 4,000 activity units targeting specific mathematics
and reading skills, enabling self-paced learning,
individualized reward, and feedback upon interaction with
the software. Children learned through low-cost tablets.
The software recorded application use in school and fed
the information back to teachers. Early primary schooling
outcomes were improved and the use of these applications
has been scaled up through iterative evaluations
(Pitchford et al., 2018; Pitchford, 2022).
Foreign language learning typically uses drill and
practice software, but few of these applications have
been rigorously evaluated. Applications such as Quizlet,
launched in 2007, focus on developing ready-to-use
sets of online flashcards for various languages (Sippel,
2022). Analysis of lower secondary schools in the
Republic of Korea found that students who had used
Quizlet scored better on vocabulary tests than students
receiving traditional teacher-led instruction (Cho, 2021).

Evaluations in the use of Quizlet in university settings in
Japan and Saudi Arabia showed significant improvement
in vocabulary learning after 10 weeks and 1 month
respectively (Dizon, 2016; Sanosi, 2018). But evaluations
of Duolingo, a widely used foreign language application,
which includes drill-focused instructional methods
and game-based components, have generally been
quantitative or based on purposive samples, with limited
investigation on how the learning was facilitated
(Shortt et al., 2021).

Preloaded content needs to be adapted to context
and come with tailored support
In the early 2000s, there was much optimism that the One
Laptop Per Child project and other free device initiatives
would help educate children in low- and middle-income
countries (Warschauer and Ames, 2010). The model provided
low-cost, low-maintenance laptops with low connectivity
requirements and loaded with open-source learning materials
which had been developed for free. The laptops aimed to
promote learning by doing, encouraging students to share their
experiences and learn together.
Several studies have documented the failure – in particular
for girls – of the One Laptop Per Child and related models
focused on hardware to improve learning outcomes (Evans
and Yuan, 2021; Gupta and Sarin, 2022; Jordan and Myers,
2022). Reasons for failure include overambitious costing plans,
unsustainability in local contexts and inadequate integration
into pedagogical processes (Ames, 2019; Souter, 2021).
Peru had the largest One Laptop Per Child programme
globally, with over 900,000 laptops distributed to rural,
disadvantaged students (Trucano, 2012). An evaluation of
data collected after 15 months of implementation in 318 rural
primary schools showed that the programme had no positive
impact on mathematics and language test scores, although
there was some inconclusive evidence on positive effects on
general cognitive skills. Implementation challenges and a lack
of integration into existing pedagogical practices prevented
learning gains. While the programme’s aim was for laptops to
be used at home and at school, only about 40% of students
were taking the laptops home. While the laptops were
preloaded with age-appropriate e-books, a lack of internet
access and interfaces meant that it was difficult for children
to install other games or applications (Cristia et al., 2017).
Teachers were trained to use the laptops and the software
but less so to implement the programme in classroom work.
In practice, laptops were being used to copy texts from the
blackboard. Students also learned how to do creative activities,
but there was little pedagogical work (Cueto, 2023).

SUPPLEMENTING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME CAN
DELIVER GOOD OUTCOMES WITH TEACHER SUPPORT
Several large-scale interventions have focused on
computer-assisted interventions that involve games or
practice sessions. In Morazan, El Salvador, after-school,
offline delivery of the Khan Academy portal in
grades 3 to 6 in 300 primary schools provided two
additional lessons of 90 minutes per week of additional
mathematics instruction, effectively doubling it.
An evaluation found that teacher-assisted Khan Academy
lessons outperformed the traditional approach to teaching
mathematics (Büchel et al., 2020).
Comparing in-school and after-school versions of
the same intervention shows that the latter tend to
deliver better outcomes. In the Indian state of Gujarat,
a computer-assisted learning model was provided to a
relatively well-functioning network of schools run by a
non-governmental organization. The programme was not
used as a substitute for the teacher-delivered curriculum.
Applying the model in school was found to reduce student
learning, but when implemented as a complementary
after-school programme, it generated large gains,
especially for weaker and older students (Linden, 2008).
Three experiments in China provide evidence on the
potential of technology when used as a supplementary
intervention. First, an intervention which provided two
40-minute computer-assisted sessions per subject
per week in 171 primary schools and required students
to practice playing games was more effective when
implemented outside school (Mo et al, 2015). Second,
a computer-assisted learning programme in rural public
schools was more effective when implemented by a
non-governmental organization than a government agency
because it was less likely to have been used to substitute
for regular instruction and had more direct monitoring.
Benefits likely came from the extra instructional time
that was facilitated rather than the computer-assisted
aspect of the programme (Mo et al., 2020). Third, another
experiment with more than 4,000 students in rural China
similarly showed that while a computer-assisted learning
programme appeared to enhance academic outcomes,
it was not the technology component that made the
difference (Ma et al., 2020).
Advancements in educational platforms and tools powered
by AI may allow time spent on repetitive tasks, such as
preparing teaching resources and assessments, to be
redirected towards facilitating classroom discussion
(Bhutoria, 2022). But computer software can also disrupt
teaching time and demands additional teacher inputs.
A programme that provided supplemental mathematics
software and instruction in 52 low-performing primary

75

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

schools in the US state of California found that 2 years
of its use produced no effect. Only 21% of teachers were
observed drawing connections between the games and
what the class was learning. The ability of such games to
teach skills that transfer to the mathematics classroom
may have been lower than expected and the programme
required classroom teachers to reinforce and create
linkages (Rutherford et al., 2014).
PERSONALIZATION AND SOFTWARE ADAPTATION
CAN TARGET SUPPORT TO STUDENTS
There is a general trend towards enhancing personalization
features that adapt or adjust to student learning levels.
Personalized adaptive software generates analytics that
can help teachers track student progress, identify error
patterns, provide differentiated opportunities for practice,
make feedback more specific and reduce teacher workload
on routine tasks (Baker, 2016).

Personalized adaptive software generates
analytics that can help teachers carry out a
variety of routine tasks

Rigorous evaluations of commercial software mostly come
from the United States. They tend to have mixed results.
The mathematics homework platform ASSISTments
uses formative assessment to give students immediate
feedback and guide teachers to use the data. An evaluation
among grade 7 students in 43 schools in the US state of
Maine showed that students used the programme for
less than 10 minutes per day, 3 to 4 times per week and
improved mathematics scores by 0.18 standard deviations
(Roschelle et al., 2016), which is considered a low impact.
Students with low prior mathematics achievement
benefited the most: they may have benefited from
teachers targeting their homework review around
common errors or deeper discussions around solutions
(Murphy et al., 2020).
The Carnegie Learning MATHia software provides
students with one-to-one coaching in mathematics.
A study in 147 schools across 7 states showed that its
implementation improved the median upper secondary
school student’s performance by approximately eight
percentile points (Pane et al., 2013). A 2021 study based on
longitudinal data from 100,000 students in the US state of
Florida found that using MATHia in lower secondary school
led to better outcomes in algebra, especially for weaker
students (Student Achievement Partners, 2021).

4

Not all widely used software interventions have strong
evidence of positive effects compared to teacher-led
instruction. ALEKS, an AI learning and assessment
system, has been used by over 25 million students for
mathematics, chemistry, statistics and accounting in the
United States. A meta-analysis of 15 empirical studies
between 2005 and 2015 found that it was as good as,
but not better than, traditional classroom teaching (Fang
et al., 2019). An updated analysis found that it was more
effective when used to supplement traditional instruction
(Sun et al., 2021).
A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials
of digital personalized learning initiatives in low- and
middle-income countries found a significant positive,
if moderate, effect. Approaches which adapt to the
learners’ level had a significantly greater impact on
learning than those that do not (Major et al., 2021).
Geekie, a Brazilian adaptive learning programme, uses
machine learning to provide personalized learning. It flags
specific learning difficulties encountered by students,
helping teachers intervene as necessary. An analysis
conducted with 400 schools, 14,000 teachers and
130,000 families found that Geekie was highly rated,
but evaluations of such commercial products typically
do not include impact assessments (Myers et al., 2022).
Personalized adaptive learning is also spreading in India.
Evaluations of one software tool documented learning
gains for weak students (Box 4.3).
Artificial intelligence may be built into personalized
adaptive technology software to help select the most
appropriate content. For instance, writing tools can
scaffold student writing by automating proofreading,
translating and providing feedback (Yan, 2023). Secondary
school students using Google Translate in Chile as part
of an English as a foreign language course significantly
improved their writing style and accuracy relative to
those who did not use the tool (Cancino and Panes,
2021). Teachers evaluated positively writing assignments
completed with Google Translate in a Hong Kong,
China primary school on grammar, vocabulary and
comprehensibility (Stapleton and Kin, 2019). But such
positive evaluations analyse the finished products,
not how students engaged and learned with these tools
(Stevenson and Phakiti, 2019). Students might focus on
correcting their errors and not on constructively applying
the feedback to improve their writing (Koltovskaia, 2020).
Similarly, overdependence on chatbots like ChatGPT may
reduce students’ higher order cognitive skills, such as
creativity, critical thinking, reasoning and problem-solving.

B OX 4. 3:

A commercial personalized adaptive software in
India has invested in its evaluation
Mindspark, developed by Educational Initiatives, is a feecharging software service focused on personalized learning
for English, mathematics and science. The software includes
an extensive item-level database of test questions and student
responses to benchmark students' initial learning level and
help personalize the material. Partnerships have been reached
with state governments, for instance, of Rajasthan
(Bhargava, 2022). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
software was made available online in 10 states across India
for learners to use at home (Ei Shiksha, 2021).
The effectiveness of the software was evaluated in afterschool centres and public and private schools in India. In afterschool centres serving low-income neighbourhoods in Delhi,
Ei Mindspark was used for 6 days of instruction per week for
90 minutes per day: 45 minutes of self-driven learning and
45 minutes of instructional support from a teaching assistant.
Attending the centres for 90 days resulted in significant gains
in mathematics and language, with relatively higher gains for
students who performed worse at the baseline. The effect is
linked to combining the computer-aided learning programme,
group-based instruction and extra instructional time. The
evaluation argued that the positive effect could be attributed
to the programme’s adaptiveness and its ability to target
instructional materials at the level of the student, since a
comparable after-school tutoring programme in operation
at the same time had no impact on test scores
(Muralidharan et al., 2019).
In less disadvantaged schools, studies showed that the
software helped with remediation in mathematics. One study
focused on independent practice among students in grades
4 to 7 in unaided private schools in 7 cities. After six months,
additional time on practice had no effect on the average
student’s achievement, but students who initially had low
performance slightly outperformed similar students who did
not use the software (de Barros et al., 2022). Another impact
analysis focused on students in grades 6 to 8 in 15 model
public schools. After nine months, personalized learning had no
effect on the achievement of the average student but students
with low initial performance outperformed their counterparts
by 0.22 standard deviations, a small effect, helping them catch
up with their peers (de Barros and Ganimian, 2021).

By simplifying the process of obtaining information, it
can negatively impact student motivation to perform
independent research and derive solutions
(Kasneci et al., 2023).

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES APPEAR TO
IMPROVE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT
Digital technologies – games, interactive whiteboards,
simulators and collaboration tools – when effectively
integrated in pedagogy by teachers and with appropriately
designed features can engage students through varied
representations and interaction. Some of these tools can
also enhance parental and caregiver support and indirectly
affect student outcomes.
DIGITAL GAMES FACILITATE KNOWLEDGE
ACQUISITION IN INTERACTIVE WAYS
Educational games and the incorporation of gamification
elements in digital learning can improve academic
and non-academic skills through increasing learners’
interaction (Schindler et al., 2017). Playing computer
games has been found to support learning in science,
mathematics and second languages compared to other
forms of instruction. They can motivate students to initiate
game play and persist in learning for longer durations
(Mayer et al., 2019). A systematic review of 43 studies on
digital game–based applications in mathematics education
found a mostly positive impact on knowledge acquisition,
cognitive skills and motivation to study mathematics
(Hussein et al., 2022). In Brazil, a game-based intervention
to help primary school students learn and practise four
basic arithmetic operations using tablets involved playing
the game for up to 20 minutes during the school day for
two months. Compared to a control group, students’
scores in mathematics increased, an impact that persisted
a year after the evaluation (Hirata, 2022).
Game-based applications are being used more and more in
low-resource settings to practise literacy and mathematics
skills. In Cambodia, the Total Reading Approach for Children
Plus initiative is a game-based application developed by a
non-governmental organisation. It promoted early grade
reading among struggling grade 1 to 3 students with a
pedagogy that focused on practising the Khmer alphabet,
vocabulary and phonetics, complementing the early grade
reading curriculum. A study found positive perceptions
of its impact on grade 2 and 3 students in reading.
The interactive game-based nature, user-friendly interface
and related instructional support engaged learners and
educators, although the design needed further alignment
to users’ needs and capabilities (Oakley et al., 2022).

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

A systematic review of literature on mobile-learning
applications targeting refugees showed that one in three
applications studied were learning approaches based
on games (Drolia et al., 2022). In Jordan, using Feed
the Monster, a game-based smartphone application,
for 22 hours over 2 months improved foundational literacy
skills among Syrian refugee children. The game also
increased peer interaction and received positive feedback
from parents (Koval-Saifi and Plass, 2018).
A review of empirical and theoretical studies on
gamification showed that gaming strategies and features,
such as multimedia, graphics, role playing, competition
through leader boards and rewards with digital points and
badges for completing activities, had a positive influence
on students’ motivation to learn, decision-making and
collaboration skills (Dichev and Dicheva, 2017). Kahoot!,
a game-based learning platform, was reportedly used
by at least half of all students in the United States in
2022, as well as more than 24 million users and 8 million
teachers globally (Kahoot!, 2023). A review of 93 studies
found that Kahoot! can have a positive effect on learning
compared to other tools and approaches, in various
contexts and domains. Qualitative studies identified the
use of leader boards, audiovisual features like high-quality
animated graphics, individual feedback and increased
classroom interaction as contributing to an engaging
learning environment (Wang and Tahir, 2020).
Adult interaction can influence the learning impact of
game-based interventions. GraphoGame is an adaptive
digital game used in over 20 countries that promotes
reading fluency by helping children develop sound–
symbol connections. It automatizes repeated practice
of word recognition and provides immediate feedback.
A meta-analysis of 19 studies measuring its impact on
word reading in multiple languages did not find an overall
positive impact. However, while self-use was associated
with no effect, adult involvement was associated with
positive effects (McTigue et al., 2020). A French study
of GraphoGame with a sample of grade 1 students from
disadvantaged neighbourhoods found that 4 months
of playing the game 4 times a week for 30 minutes had
a positive impact on word-reading fluency, as teachers
provided active support throughout (Lassault et al., 2022).
Augmented and virtual reality technology in games can
also affect student attitudes towards certain subjects.
A systematic review found that digital simulation–based
games had a positive impact on learner motivation to
study physics (Ullah et al., 2022). Simulations of real-world
scenarios in digital games allow students to role-play,
practise prosocial behaviours and learn decision-making in
less intimidating virtual spaces (Rui, 2023). A game-based

social and emotional learning programme for
grade 3 students in the US state of California, including
weekly videos with stories and narratives, a game and
an assessment, improved interpersonal communications
and skills, including emotional regulation and empathy,
compared to a control group (Sanchez et al., 2017).

INTERACTIVE WHITEBOARDS CAN ENGAGE
LEARNERS TO SUPPORT LEARNING
Interactive whiteboards or smartboards can potentially
support the visual, auditory and tactile experiences of
teaching and learning (Abdullah et al., 2021). In European
Union countries, the number of primary school
students per interactive whiteboard halved from 111 in
2011/12 to 56 in 2017/18 (Deloitte and Ipsos MORI, 2019).
A meta-analysis found smartboards to be more effective
than traditional instruction based on lectures, due to
their potential to engage learners. However, the effects
may be linked less to their interactivity and more to the
pedagogical approaches of the teachers using them, such
as collaborative and active learning (Shi et al., 2020).
Pedagogical integration of whiteboards by teachers
determines whether they are used merely as projection
tools or for effectively stimulating student interaction and
classroom activities (De Vita et al., 2018).
Governments have significantly invested in interactive
whiteboards with varied impacts. The United Kingdom
was an early large-scale adopter in the 2000s.
An evaluation of their pilot introduction in 200 classrooms
found that teachers and 9- to 11-year-old students were
overwhelmingly supportive (Moss and Jewitt, 2010). As a
result, the programme was scaled up and, by 2007, they
were being used extensively in teaching (Smith et al.,
2008). However, interactive whiteboards were often
used simply as a replacement for blackboards and their
interactive capabilities not necessarily used (DiGregorio
and Sobel-Lojeski, 2010). In Türkiye, the Ministry of
National Education introduced smartboards in more
than 570,000 classrooms as part of a nationwide ICT
reform project, starting in 2011, to integrate ICT into the
education system (Esara and Sinan, 2017). A meta-analysis
of 47 experimental studies on the use of smartboards

in Turkish classrooms for multiple subjects found large
positive effects on achievement (Akar, 2020).
When used as a teaching aid, smartboards can help explain
complex concepts and save classroom time. As part of
an effort to digitize primary schools in Senegal, an ICT
intervention, Project Sankoré, introduced interactive
whiteboards in classrooms along with pre-installed
content software. An evaluation of 122 schools reported
that the boards’ visualization capabilities allowed teachers
to not have to draw complex diagrams and use the saved
time for class discussions. Student test scores improved in
French, mathematics and life sciences (Lehrer et al., 2019).
The quality of teacher training is critical. In Catalonia,
an autonomous community of Spain, a programme
provided interactive whiteboards along with one-to-one
devices to more than 600 schools. Teachers reported using
interactive whiteboards mostly like a common projector
to display digital textbooks and slides. But teachers who
had received specialized training using examples from
publishers and peers were more likely to use the boards
interactively to generate content or allow students to write
on them (Grimalt-Álvaro et al., 2019).
SIMULATION SUPPORTS EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING IN
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL FIELDS
Augmented, mixed or virtual reality are being used
as experiential learning tools, providing attractive
visualizations, interactivity and opportunities for
repeated practice in life-like conditions. Such simulations
facilitate practical learning in fields such as medicine
and engineering (Angel-Urdinola et al., 2021) but are
also being used in secondary school science classrooms.
According to teacher reported data in the TIMSS, the share
of grade 8 students who experienced simulations in
science classrooms increased by 12 percentage points
between 2007 and 2015 but by twice as much in Israel
and the United States. The highest share was observed
in Türkiye, with half of students experiencing simulations
(Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2019) (Figure 4.3).
Online science laboratories allow unlimited repetitions of
experiments in a safe and cost-efficient manner; they can
be software-based, virtual or remotely controlled physical
laboratories (Potkonjak et al., 2016). The Global Online
Science Labs for Inquiry Learning in Schools, or Go-Lab,
initiative funded by the European Union provides access
to 600 virtual laboratories to students and teachers of
science, technology, engineering and mathematics in
50 countries in Europe and Africa, often in partnership with
ministries of education (Go-Lab, 2023). The labs enable
experiential, collaborative and inquiry-based learning by

allowing teachers to demonstrate and students to conduct
repeated and diverse scientific experiments. In Estonia,
the University of Tartu Institute of Education has
incorporated Go-Lab into teacher education programmes
to foster a teaching culture that emphasizes inquiry and
collaboration. The Ministry of Education has revised its
digital science assessments, emphasizing scientific inquiry
abilities drawing from Go-Lab’s inquiry-based learning
model (Gillet et al., 2017).

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

Practical training based on virtual reality may be less
effective than real-life training but more effective than
other digital methods such as video demonstrations.
A meta-analysis of 145 empirical studies of technology
effectiveness in simulation-based learning environments
in tertiary education found that live simulations involving
human patients in medical education had the highest
positive impact on learning outcomes compared to all
other digital simulations. However, compared to viewing
two-dimensional computer screen simulations, virtual
reality simulations were associated with larger positive
effects, allowing for interaction and stimulating student
sensory perceptions (Chernikova et al., 2020).
Simulated environments or digital three-dimensional
models of workplaces support experiential learning that
engages students, encourages inquiry and allows for
repeated practice opportunities with reduced occupational
risks and hazards (ILO, 2021). They can be an alternative
for or supplement on-the-job training (OECD, 2021).
Accordingly, augmented and virtual reality technology
is being used in technical and vocational education and
training (TVET) institutions. Denmark has established
a Knowledge Centre to foster the use of advanced
simulation technologies in TVET. In a survey of its social
and healthcare programme students, almost 70% declared
that virtual reality was an effective supplement to regular
teaching and more than 40% reported improvements in
learning outcomes (OECD, 2021).
MilleaLab, a software platform used to create virtual
reality–based educational content, was developed in
2019 by a partnership between the Southeast Asian
Ministers of Education Organisation Regional Open
Learning Centre and the Indonesian TVET provider
Shinta VR. Millealab has enabled access to virtual learning
courses to 1,500 schools and has trained 5,200 teachers in
the development and use of virtual reality–based learning
content, even without them having coding skills knowledge
(UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2021a).
Virtual reality training modules provide an interactive
environment for students to train in preparation for the
workplace (European Union, 2020) and some professions
with high-risk work environments have adopted simulation
technology in their training and assessment programmes
(Morélot et al., 2021). In the Flemish Community of
Belgium, teachers are developing high-quality virtual
reality training modules as part of VRGhoote, a secondary
TVET training initiative which allows students to safely
train in a simulated high-risk work environment and
practise operating machinery such as wind turbines
(European Commission, 2020). In Ecuador, the Secretariat
of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation

B OX 4.4:

Flipped classrooms are changing instruction in higher education
Flipped classrooms, a type of blended pedagogical approach, are being employed in higher education, aided by the development
of diverse technological tools for recording, editing and publishing videos, and online video platforms (Bredow et al., 2021;
Robertson and Flowers, 2020). Students study the material before class, by watching online lectures or pre-recorded videos,
at their own pace and apply the learning material during class, allowing the classroom experience to shift from being teacher-centred
to learner-centred (Strelan et al., 2020).
This approach has been mainly evaluated in higher education settings (Jdaitawi, 2019) and notably in the United States and in Asian
countries including China, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea (Kushairi and Ahmi, 2021). Given evidence that it improves student
engagement (Lee, 2018), the Republic of Korea Ministry of Education has encouraged the use of flipped classrooms in higher
education, especially for teaching science. Universities may make it mandatory for newly hired faculty to teach flipped classes across
disciplines (Kim, 2021).
A meta-analysis of 95 studies showed that the flipped classroom model had a moderate positive effect on learning achievement and
motivation compared to the traditional classroom model. In class, tools such as online discussion forums and games produced larger
effect sizes than online learning platforms. Of the resources used before class, video recordings had the highest effect (Zheng et al.,
2020). Effectiveness also varies by the subject taught. A review of more than 300 studies highlighted the positive effect on both academic
and intra-/interpersonal outcomes of flipped classroom interventions using video support but the effect size was larger for language and
technology than for engineering and mathematics (Bredow et al., 2021) (Figure 4.4).

However, effective use of this pedagogical approach is contingent on students being able to self-regulate their learning and having
ICT equipment at home (Lo and Hew, 2017). Teachers also need to be able to use classroom time to effectively stimulate student
collaboration and need to prepare lessons before class. Adapting to two modes of instruction can increase their workload (Bülow, 2022).

reality technology to recreate hazardous situations, where
students can gain practical experience in identifying and
mitigating industrial risks. The added gamified experience
allows students to practise and teachers to provide
feedback in real time (Angel-Urdinola et al., 2022).
The COVID-19 crisis boosted TVET providers’ use of
simulation technologies as an alternative to practical
on-the-job training. In Malaysia, the Tun Hussein Onn
University developed the Digital TVET Learning Platform.
Teachers integrated augmented and virtual reality
components in their lessons to simulate real-life problems
in classroom and laboratory activities (UNESCO-UNEVOC,
2021b). Yet according to a joint survey of TVET providers,
policymakers and other stakeholders in 126 countries,
less than 20% of upper-middle- and high-income country
respondents reported using simulations, augmented and
virtual reality tools (ILO et al., 2020).

boundaries, provide a visual representation of ongoing
assignments, facilitate asynchronous group work and
promote knowledge co-creation (Wang and Shen, 2023).
In a meta-analysis of 425 empirical studies, almost all
studies that explored the role of computers in fostering
collaborative learning reported significant positive effects
on student perceptions, group task performance and social
interaction (Chen et al., 2018).
Online discussion forums and cloud-based
word-processing platforms allow learners to collaborate
on the same task at the same time (Wang and Shen, 2023).
A review of 34 empirical studies on technology-supported
collaborative writing found that wikis, Google Docs, offline
word processors, Facebook, chats and forums had a
positive impact on student engagement, group interaction
and peer feedback (Zhang and Zou, 2021). In Bangladesh,
students who used wikis for online collaborative writing
had a positive perception of online word processing, such
as being able to write and edit recursively (Ara, 2023).
A quasi-experimental study in the Islamic Republic of Iran
compared two classes of English learning and found that
the use of Google Docs for peer editing improved learners’
writing skills compared to traditional face-to-face settings
(Ebadi and Rahimi, 2017).

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

Audio and video conferencing tools for synchronous
and asynchronous distance learning can facilitate
collaborative learning by reducing time and space barriers
(Wang and Shen, 2023). Virtual learning environments
encourage participation from more vulnerable and passive
students by allowing them more time to think and reflect
on their interventions that can be sent in writing compared
to speaking up in traditional classroom settings
(Chen et al., 2018). One such approach, the flipped
classroom, combines face-to-face with online learning
(Box 4.4).
However, collaborative learning pedagogies need to
be integrated into the teaching process. A quantitative
meta-analysis of 46 studies on augmented reality
interventions indicated that the highest impact on learning
outcomes was obtained when interventions employed a
collaborative pedagogical approach (Garzón et al., 2020).
Studies on online peer editing have emphasized that the
quality of student interaction depends on the pedagogical
approach employed by the teacher (Zhang et al., 2022).
In Sweden, Write to Learn, a structured pedagogical
approach to using ICT in early grades, emphasizes
collaborative work and classroom interaction. For writing
tasks, students use software to share their texts with
peers and teachers continuously give and receive feedback
during the process. An analysis of grade 1 and 3 students
showed that 78% of students taught with this approach
passed the national standard tests in literacy and
mathematics, compared to 59% of those who followed the
traditional method and 50% of those who used ICT without
collaborative feedback (Genlott and Grönlund, 2016).

Short, light-touch, nudging interventions
involve sending parents regular reminders to
engage with their children’s learning

TECHNOLOGY HELPS PARENTS ENGAGE WITH THEIR
CHILDREN’S LEARNING
Technology provides teachers with several low-cost
and convenient ways to communicate up-to-date
information to parents about their child’s school progress
(Nicolai et al., 2023). ICT can be used to improve parental
knowledge and practices through training, informing and
nudging them (Nicolai et al., 2023). Short, light-touch,
nudging interventions involve sending parents regular
reminders to engage with their children’s learning using
low-cost modalities, such as through text messages.

4

A systematic review of 29 studies found that such
behavioural interventions resulted in improvements in
academic outcomes (See et al., 2020), school attendance,
and parental involvement in activities at home and in
school (Berlinski et al., 2021). In Côte d’Ivoire, nudges
were sent twice a week for a full year to caregivers in
100 public schools and were found, compared to a control
group, to be associated with halving student dropout
(Lichand and Wolf, 2020). In low-income neighbourhoods
of Cape Town, South Africa, more than 1,000 households
were sent weekly text messages to encourage children to
regularly attend a government after-school programme.
After 10 weeks, learners whose parents received text
messages attended the sessions 6% more on average than
learners who belonged to a control group (Owsley, 2017).
The Parent Engagement Project sent an average of
30 texts to each parent over an 11-month period in
36 English secondary schools. The texts included
information on child performance and upcoming tests
and assignments. An independent evaluation found that
children whose parents received these texts improved
their learning in mathematics by the equivalent of a
month’s worth of additional progress and reduced school
absenteeism compared to children in the control group.
Most parents accepted the content, frequency and timing
of messages (Education Endowment Foundation, 2016).
READY4K!, a preschool literacy programme implemented
in San Francisco, United States, sent parents three text
messages per week over a duration of eight months on
easy-to-implement home literacy activities. Children
whose parents received these text messages performed
higher in literacy tests, especially those who previously
scored below the class median (York and Loeb, 2018).
A smartphone application, EasyPeasy, sends parents
of preschool-age children weekly text messages
with educational game ideas to implement at home.
An evaluation of its implementation over 20 weeks
in about 100 nurseries in the United Kingdom
reported improvements in home learning activities
(Robinson-Smith et al., 2019).
Moreover, learning with technology at home makes
parental help particularly important so that students can
apply the feedback received, as it became clear during
COVID-19 (Box 4.5). Children sometimes struggle to use
feedback received from education technology software
without adult support (Vasalou et al., 2021).

B OX 4. 5:

COVID-19 distance learning relied on
engaging parents
During the COVID-19 school closures, governments used ICT to
communicate with parents and caregivers to engage them to
help their children’s learning. Information campaigns using text
messages and instant messaging platforms provided regular
updates and shared resources for supporting home learning.
After the closure for early childhood development centres,
the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare launched a distance
education initiative that targeted 1.7 million disadvantaged
children. The programme relied on WhatsApp and other
social media platforms to relay guidance to caregivers on
simple pedagogical activities for children’s development at
home (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022). The Madhya Pradesh
state department of education in India, under the #Ab padhai
nahi rukegi (#Learning will not stop) campaign, created a
WhatsApp group for each of its over 50,000 schools to share
learning materials, which reached over 1.9 million parents and
200,000 teachers. A dedicated WhatsApp monitoring team
was set up to oversee the content that was being circulated
(Batra et al., 2022).
Schools and teachers engaged with parents using phone
calls and instant messaging platforms to support them,
deliver lessons and receive children’s homework
(Nicolai et al., 2023). In Botswana, the Ministry of Basic
Education leveraged weekly text messages and phone
calls from teachers to parents to continue implementing
the Teaching at the Right Level programme to improve
foundational literacy and numeracy. During the pandemic,
parents received over-the-phone tutoring on basic numeracy
concepts. An evaluation among 4,500 households found
primary school children’s foundational numeracy skills
improving compared to a control group. Parents engaged more
with their children in education activities and could correctly
identify their child’s learning level and needs (Angrist et al.,
2022). In Mexico, teachers used WhatsApp to communicate
with students and parents via text, collect pictures of student
work, and answer student questions through voice or video
calls (Castellanos-Reyes et al., 2022).
Despite their potential, the uptake and effectiveness of these
interventions are limited by factors such as parental education
levels, caregiver beliefs about education, and lack of time and
material resources (Nicolai et al., 2023). A 24-week behavioural
nudge via text messages to increase caregiver engagement
in Ghana found that it increased at-home and in-school
engagement of those who had attended school compared to
their peers with no education (Aurino et al., 2022).

INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGY
USE NEGATIVELY IMPACTS
STUDENT PERFORMANCE
AND INCREASES DISRUPTION
In contrast to digital technology’s potential to improve
education, there are also risks of ICT in education, which
are often ignored by research and evaluations. Student
use of devices beyond a moderate threshold may have
a negative impact on academic performance. The use
of smartphones and computers disrupts classroom and
home learning activity. A meta-analysis of research
on the relationship between student mobile phone
use and educational outcomes covering students from
pre-primary to higher education in 14 countries found a
small negative effect, which was larger at the university
level. The decline is mostly linked to increased distraction
and time spent on non-academic activities during learning
hours. Incoming notifications or the mere proximity of a
mobile device can be a distraction, resulting in students
losing their attention from the task at hand. The use of
smartphones in classrooms leads to students engaging
in non-school-related activities, which affects recall and
comprehension (Kates et al., 2018). A study found that it
can take students up to 20 minutes to refocus on what
they were learning after engaging in a non-academic
activity (Carrier et al., 2015; Dontre, 2021). Negative
effects are also reported in students from the use of
personal computers for non-academic activities during
class, such as internet browsing, and in their peers who
are in view of the screen (Hall et al., 2020).
Studies using data from large-scale international
assessments, such as PISA, also indicate a negative
association between excessive ICT use and student
performance (Gorjón and Osés, 2022). By categorizing ICT
usage at home and in school as low, medium or high, more
intensive use beyond a threshold was most often found
to be correlated with diminishing academic performance
while moderate usage was most often associated with
positive academic outcomes. Analysis of 2018 PISA data
from 79 countries constructed an online activity index
based on online activities such as emailing, scheduling
events, web browsing and chatting. After controlling
for various student-, school- and country-level factors,
a positive association was found between ICT use and
reading, mathematics and science scores up to a threshold
of optimal use. Beyond a ‘several times a week’ threshold,
diminishing academic gains were reported. The finding that
excessive use of ICT does not provide extra returns beyond
a level remained consistent across all socioeconomic
categories of students (Bhutoria and Aljabri, 2022).

83

C H A P T E R 4 • T eaching and learning

Incoming notifications or the mere proximity
of a mobile device can be a distraction, leading
to students losing their attention from the
task at hand

Medium levels of ICT use were consistently associated
with better reading outcomes in another study that used
PISA data. While the number of students classified as
high ICT users rose between 2009 and 2018, significant
positive impacts on academic outcomes were not observed
(Borgonovi and Pokropek, 2021). After controlling for
gender and socioeconomic status, analysis of 2015 PISA
data from the Netherlands found that students with
moderate access and use of ICT for homework, both at
and outside school, had the highest reading performance
(Gubbels et al., 2020).
Studies on teacher perceptions of the use of tablets and
phones highlight difficulties in classroom management,
when students visit websites other than those indicated
by teachers or due to the increased level of noise in the
classroom (Nikolopoulou, 2020). More than one in three
teachers from seven countries that participated in the
2018 ICILS – and one in two teachers in Denmark – agreed
that the use of ICT in classrooms distracts students from
learning (Fraillon et al., 2020). The use of social media
in the classroom is also disruptive, increasing academic
distraction with negative effects on learning outcomes
(Dontre, 2021). Analysis of PISA data between 2009 and
2018 showed a negative corelation between the use of
social media in school and digital reading performance
(Hu and Yu, 2021).
Online learning, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic,
relies on student ability to self-regulate learning and may
therefore put low-performing students further at risk
of disengagement; experimental studies indicate that
high-performing students find it easier to engage with
technology in productive ways (Bergdahl et al., 2020).
In Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, not only did
student performance decline, but inequality increased,
likely due to factors such as a lack of family support. In the
Netherlands, after eight weeks of school closure, learning
losses were up to 60% greater among students whose
parents were less educated (Azevedo et al., 2022). Analysis
of more than 2.1 million primary and lower secondary
school students in 10,000 schools in the United States
found that schools in high-poverty neighbourhoods
spent about 5.5 more weeks in remote instruction in
2020/21 compared to schools in low- and medium-poverty

4

neighbourhoods and reported lower academic outcomes
(Goldhaber et al., 2022).
The switch to online learning affected primary school
learners more than older students, who may have
been able to sustain their learning better in a remote
environment. In Switzerland, in a comparison eight weeks
before and during school closures, secondary school
students sustained learning progress in online learning,
while learning gains for primary school children slowed
down. Both primary and secondary school children learned
twice as fast from in-person instruction compared to
remote instruction (Tomasik et al., 2021).
Apart from immediate disruptions to teaching and
learning, the use of technology is associated with
negative impacts on physical and mental well-being and
increased susceptibility to online risks and harms, which
affect academic performance in the long term. Education
systems have adopted various approaches, ranging from
restricting use of devices to banning them completely
(Chapter 8).

Positive impact is often dependent on strong
pedagogical alignment and teacher input

CONCLUSION
Technology has great promise for improving existing
teaching and learning processes. However, evidence of
success is limited and this is particularly true of large-scale
research that systematically explores how technology
can facilitate positive changes in a sustained way and in
diverse contexts. Attributing conclusive, specific learning
outcomes to hardware or software is challenging.
Positive impact is often dependent on strong pedagogical
alignment and teacher input.
Evidence on the use and effectiveness of technology
shows that beyond affecting individual learning outcomes,
it can both facilitate and disrupt teaching and learning
processes. While technology offers many affordances –
supplementing and personalizing instruction, offering
more opportunities for practice, stimulating student
engagement through audiovisual, interactive and
collaborative ways – it can also increase the risk of
distraction and disengagement.
Given the overwhelming number of technology products
and platforms available, governments need to base
their decisions on procurement and scaling up on
reliable evidence that looks at the long-term effects
of interventions, carefully considering all pedagogical
elements involved. The design and delivery of education
technology interventions need to be tailored to local
contexts. Successful technology interventions rely upon
the long-established building blocks of strong pedagogical
integration by teachers, additional instructional time and
robust facilitation.

KE Y MESSAGES
Countries are starting to define the digital skills they want to prioritize in curricula and assessment standards.
National digital skills standards are emerging.


Digital skills' definitions constantly evolve. About 90% of countries aspire to develop digital skills, and 54% have
established digital skills standards.



The European Union’s Digital Competence Framework, DigComp 2.2, is being used to develop strategies, curricula
and assessment tools. But too many countries adopt digital skills frameworks developed by non-state, mostly
commercial, actors.

It is hard to measure digital skills.


Commercial digital skills frameworks are narrower and usually tied to assessment tools that, for a fee, offer
certification for labour market purposes. Government digital skills frameworks are broader but assessments
vary by purpose, target group, uptake, item development, reliability, validity, delivery mode, cost, scalability and
responsible authority.



Assessments of digital skills need to address three issues: multidimensionality, comparability over time, and
fairness.

Current measures suggest low digital skills levels and wide gaps.


The gender gap in digital skills widens for particular skills. In 50 countries, just 3.2% of females compared to 6.5% of
males can write a computer program.



Digital skills vary by background. In Germany, 10% of adults whose parents did not attain upper secondary
education achieved minimum proficiency level in problem-solving skills, compared with 53% of those with at least
one parent who attained tertiary education.

Digital skills are acquired in formal education but often outside it.


A 2011 household survey showed that most European adults gained their ICT skills informally. But a 2018 update
showed that formal education could increase the probability of acquiring skills informally. Formal education
systems need to accept, value and integrate the experience and knowledge students acquire outside school.

Countries have developed various ways to build digital skills.

87



More than 50% of 15-year-old students in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment reported
that they had been trained at school to recognize biased information.



Communication and collaboration skills are promoted in schools through strategies other than in formal curricula.
Argentina promotes teamwork and knowledge sharing through programming and robotics competitions.



About 90% of 36 major universities in upper-middle- and high-income countries include intellectual property rights
education in their courses.



Prioritization of data privacy and security skills in school curricula is not yet common. Australia and New Zealand
have incorporated these skills as a cross-curricular theme.



Computer education is globally recognized for its importance in developing problem-solving skills, with
mandatory computer science education in Europe and extensive computer science education pilots in Central Asia,
Southeastern Asia and Latin America.

Technology innovations – from the personal computer,
the internet and search engines, to smartphones, social
media and natural language models – are transforming the
way people work and live, as individuals and as citizens.
The pace of change is unrelenting. Boundaries between
the physical world and the virtual world are becoming
porous. People, businesses and machines are always ‘on’,
hyperconnected, and the capacity to store and process
data is expanding so much that analytics determine ever
more aspects of everyday lives. People need new skills to
navigate changing economies and societies, to make the
most of opportunities as well as protect themselves from
risks. They also need to know how to shield themselves
and others from threats to security, freedoms and rights,
and understand the import of behaving as responsibly in
the digital world as they do in the physical one.
Today, two in three people in the world use the internet,
ranging from 26% in low-income to 92% in high-income
countries. Among young people, the ratio increases to
three in four globally, ranging from 39% in low-income to
99% in high-income countries (ITU, 2022c). Additionally,
people are using the internet for a wider variety of tasks.
For instance, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) countries, the percentage of
internet users who obtained information about goods and
services on the internet increased from 40% in 2005 to
75% in 2021 (OECD, 2022).

People need new skills to navigate changing
economies and societies

The explosion in demand for skills to navigate the changing
aspects of digital technology poses a major challenge to
public education and training systems, for three reasons.
First, there are multiple definitions of these skills. Some
are narrowly related to job requirements, sometimes
even associated with specific proprietary technologies.
Education systems must clearly identify which skills are
needed in order to prepare curricula. Second, it will be
costly for education systems to develop the necessary
conditions, including training educators, to keep up with a
pace of change that well exceeds what education systems
are used to: curricular reforms are estimated to take
place every 10 years on average. Third, as a result of the
slow pace of change in formal education and the rapid
and constant generation and diffusion of technological
innovation, digital skills are typically acquired out of
school. In brief, public education and training systems
cannot deliver all digital skills and have to prioritize an
essential core set.
This chapter introduces a working definition, national
frameworks and approaches to measurement of digital
skills. Despite the fact that such skills are often acquired
outside formal education systems, there are country
efforts to develop them among children, youth
and adults.

THE DEFINITION OF DIGITAL SKILLS
MUST BE BROAD
The definition of digital skills has been evolving while
digital technologies are evolving. Originally, they were
viewed from an instrumental perspective that focused on
the ability to use digital devices and online applications.
The skills typically covered basic hardware and software
operations, email, and search functions. While this
definition is relatively easy to monitor, it is too narrow
to be relevant for policy (van Dijk, 2020; Mattar et al.,

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

5

2022). Skills, along with knowledge and attitudes, should
not just enable people to use devices. Rather, they
should empower people to use digital technologies with
confidence to add value to their personal and professional
lives, to treat content critically, to protect themselves
from risks, and to act responsibly online so as not to harm
others. The purpose of these competences is explicit in
these definitions, as several organizations have tried to
demonstrate (Table 5.1).
The definition offered by the European Commission,
in particular, evolved over a decade through wide
stakeholder consultation and an open validation process,
including with the European Union’s (EU) member states.
It informs the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens
(DigComp), which was also adopted as part of the Digital
Literacy Global Framework (UIS, 2018) and is used as a
basis for the analysis of digital skills in this chapter.
DigComp is structured along five dimensions
(Vuorikari, Kluzer, et al., 2022b): 1) five competence
areas (information and data literacy, communication
and collaboration, digital content creation, safety,
and problem-solving); 2) twenty-one competences
(Table 5.2); 3) eight proficiency levels (from foundational
to highly specialized); underpinned by 4) multiple examples

(knowledge, skills and attitudes); and 5) use cases (in
employment and learning contexts) (Carretero et al., 2017).
NATIONAL DIGITAL SKILLS STANDARDS
ARE EMERGING
An analysis of PEER country profiles for this report
shows that 90% of countries aspire to develop digital
skills. Overall, 54% of countries – ranging from 25% in
sub-Saharan Africa to 80% in Europe and
Northern America – appear to have identified digital
skills standards for learners in a framework, policy, plan
or strategy (Figure 5.1). More than 20 European countries
have used the DigComp framework as a foundation
for developing strategies, education programmes and
assessment tools (Carretero et al., 2018). Such standards
can help guide education and training programmes.
Germany’s 16 federal states have developed a national
competence framework and strategy to encompass
various aspects of digital skills and associated teacher
education, school resourcing and curriculum development
(KMK, 2016). In England, United Kingdom, the Department
for Education developed the Essential Digital Skills
Framework through consultation with technology
companies, banks, business consortia and civil society
(Department of Education, 2018).

Central and Southern Asia, and Eastern and
South-eastern Asia, are the two other regions with the
highest share of standard-setting countries. These are
not limited to formal education. The Indian government
adopted the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta
Abhiyan (Prime Minister’s Rural Digital Literacy Campaign)
to enable at least one member in 60 million rural
households to operate digital devices, browse the
internet, make digital payments and access public
services. By mid-2022, 52 million had been trained and
39 million had had their training certified (India Ministry
of Electronics and Information Technology, 2022, 2023).
Some countries adopt digital skills frameworks developed
by non-state, mostly commercial, actors. For instance,
the International Computer Driving Licence (ICDL),
developed by the non-profit European Computer Driving
Licence (ECDL) Foundation, has been promoted as a
‘digital skills standard’ but is primarily associated with
Microsoft applications, as is the Microsoft Digital Literacy
Standard Curriculum (ICDL, 2023). The Certiport Internet
and Computing Core Certification, a testing arm of the

multinational publishing and education company Pearson,
is presented as a ‘worldwide benchmark’ but is associated
with selected major technology firms (Certiport, 2023).
The DQ Institute, based in Singapore, has developed
a digital intelligence framework, which was endorsed
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
Standards Association in 2020 (IEEE, 2020) and piloted
with education ministries in Mexico, Thailand and Türkiye
(Jackman et al., 2021).
A review of 47 countries at all income levels found that
ICDL was adopted by two thirds of countries, while
Certiport and the Microsoft Digital Literacy Standard
Curriculum by about one fifth of countries (UIS, 2018).
Kenya and Thailand have officially recognized and
endorsed ICDL as the only digital literacy standard for use
in schools, universities and training/education institutes
(World Bank, 2020).

DIGITAL SKILLS ARE HARD TO MEASURE
Digital skills are difficult to measure. Commercial digital
skills frameworks, which define skills narrowly, are usually
tied to assessment tools offering certification that can be
used for labour market purposes, for a fee. By contrast,
government digital skills frameworks tend be broad. As a
result, not all of these skills can be measured with one tool,
as assessments can vary by purpose, target group, uptake,
item development, reliability, validity, delivery mode, cost,
scalability, and responsible authority (UNESCO, 2019).
THERE ARE CONCEPTUAL AND OPERATIONAL
CHALLENGES IN MEASURING DIGITAL SKILLS
Assessments of digital skills need to address three
problems (Reichert et al., 2023). The first is that digital
literacy is multidimensional, and it has proven difficult
to capture all dimensions in one assessment (Ihme et al.,
2017). The second problem is comparability over time.
Monitoring tracks specific digital skills development over
time, but new technologies emerge constantly, making
this difficult. Amending assessment frameworks and tools
to capture these changes risks fundamentally changing
the digital literacy concept being measured, and can make
results non-comparable over time.

Monitoring tracks specific digital skills
development over time, but new technologies
emerge constantly, making this difficult

The third problem is fairness. Valid comparisons between
students by gender, socioeconomic status and country
require assessment tasks and items that do not favour
all groups. Biased items tend to be removed at the
design stage, but meta-analyses show that some remain
(Scherer and Siddiq, 2019). Access to digital devices and
the internet, digital skills and school conditions are linked
to socioeconomic divides (van Dijk, 2006, 2020). Also,
biases can be exacerbated in cross-national assessments.
However, one module related to problem-solving in
technology-rich environments from the Programme for
the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
(PIAAC), used in 21 countries, was found to be suitable for
country comparisons across gender, age groups, education
levels and migration backgrounds (Gorges et al., 2017).
The International Computer and Information Literacy Study
(ICILS) also examines item-by-country interactions to
detect culturally biased items, omitting those with large,
country-specific effects (Fraillon et al., 2020). However,

even in Denmark, Germany and Norway, which share
cultural affinities, study participants found some ICILS
tasks to have a different degree of difficulty
(Bundsgaard, 2019).
There are also operational challenges. Assessments
of digital skills are administered in either authentic or
simulated software environments. Authentic software
environments aim to ensure accuracy, yet the results may
reflect familiarity with a specific software rather than
general digital literacy (Reichert et al., 2020), so students
more experienced in using the assessment software
tend to obtain better test scores (UIS, 2018). Conversely,
simulated environments simplify real-world software
applications and may not fully capture student ability
to handle tasks using common software applications
(Reichert et al., 2020). Meanwhile, little is known about
the effects of different digital devices on digital literacy
performance, which may be relevant in self-administered
assessments. Also, screen size, display resolution
and display refresh rate can affect performance in
computer-based tests (Bridgeman et al., 2003;
Jensen, 2020).
CURRENT MEASURES SUGGEST LOW DIGITAL SKILL
LEVELS AND WIDE GAPS
Existing assessments try to measure digital skill levels
and progress, while acknowledging the challenges
above. The SDG 4 monitoring framework initially tried
to distinguish between a self-reported measure of
‘information and communication technology (ICT) skills’
(global indicator 4.4.1) based on household surveys and
a directly assessed measure of ‘digital literacy’ (digital
indicator 4.4.2). The first measure captures familiarity
with selected practices, and the second measure captures
some of the multiple dimensions of digital skills. However,
in practice, it has not been possible to clearly separate the
two concepts and their information sources.
Given the difficulty of carrying out direct assessments
globally, recent efforts have focused on consolidating
indicators. One example is the composite ‘digital skills’
indicator, developed by the European Commission
(Vuorikari, Jerzak, et al., 2022a). Based on a self-reported
survey in the European Union (EU) of ICT use by households
and individuals, this composite indicator assesses whether
individuals have performed selected activities on the
internet, which have been mapped against the DigComp
competence areas (Table 5.3). In total, 12 out of the
21 DigComp competences were captured by the survey,
with ongoing efforts to adapt the tool in future iterations
to meet emerging needs. One such example was the
addition of a skill measure for safety in 2021.

The digital skills indicator is being used to monitor the
EU’s Digital Decade target of 80% of adults in EU countries
possessing at least basic digital skills by 2030. As of 2021,
six levels of skill have been captured: none, limited, narrow,
low, basic and above basic. Using this typology, 54% of
adults in the 27 EU countries had at least basic skills in

2021; males were four percentage points higher than
females. The indicator, which is also estimated for non-EU
member neighbouring countries, ranged from 24% in
Albania to 81% in Iceland (Figure 5.2).

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) are co-custodian
agencies of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) global
indicator 4.4.1, which measures in part the percentage of
adults with ICT skills. They have recognized the need for
the indicator to be founded on a robust framework. The ITU
Expert Group on ICT Household Indicators has adopted
the five DigComp competence areas, with a reduced set
of questions relative to the EU digital skills indicator, as a
future basis for indicator 4.4.1, aided by a pilot exercise
in Brazil which supports a global applicability of this
approach (ITU, 2022b). According to this study, 31% of
Brazilian adults had at least basic skills, but with large,
within-country differences: the level was twice as high
in urban areas compared to rural areas, three times as
high among those in the labour force as those outside it,
and nine times as high among the top socioeconomic group
as the two bottom groups (ITU, 2022a).

Too few countries currently report competence area data
by DigComp and, even if they do, it is rarely for all five
areas. For instance, 78 countries report data on problem
solving while just 27 countries report data on safety (ITU,
2022c). For now, SDG global indicator 4.4.1 reporting by
country is still limited to nine ICT-related activities, which,
as in Brazil, reveal major differences between ages, sexes
and locations, not only between but also within countries.
For example, in 19 selected countries and territories,
the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds who could send
e-mails with an attachment was about 40% in Colombia,
Thailand and Uzbekistan but less than 5% among elderly
adults over 75 years; the share of elderly adults who could
do this exceeded 10% only in Japan (22%) and Switzerland
(58%) (Figure 5.3).

There is a gender gap in digital skills overall,
but this gap widens conspicuously in relation
to specific skills

There is a gender gap in digital skills overall, but this gap
widens conspicuously in relation to specific skills. In a
set of 50 countries and territories, 6.5% of males and
3.2% of females could write a computer program using a
specialized programming language. The differences were
particularly large in Belgium, Hungary and Switzerland,
with no more than 2 women for every 10 men able to
program. In contrast, Albania, Malaysia and Palestine
reported 9 women for every 10 men could do so
(Figure 5.4).

95

C H A P T E R 5 • D igital skills

In a set of 42 countries, differences were also observed in
the percentage of adults who can find, download, install
and configure software between urban adults (34%)
and rural adults (25%). The gap was some 15 percentage
points in Bhutan, Mexico and Zimbabwe – and almost 30 in
Bangladesh (Figure 5.5).
Significant gaps in socioeconomic status are also apparent
in direct assessments that use a multidimensional
framework of digital skills. Adults in selected
upper-middle- and high-income countries took part in the
PIAAC problem-solving in technology-rich environments
module, which aims to monitor the capacity to
communicate and obtain information through technology.
In Germany, 10% of adults whose parents had not attained
upper secondary education achieved Level 2, the minimum
proficiency level, in such problem-solving skills compared
to 53% of those with at least one parent who had attained
tertiary education (Figure 5.6).
The 2018 ICILS, which was administered to grade
8 students, set a low threshold of 26 books at home to
distinguish the disadvantaged from their more privileged
peers. In Luxembourg and Uruguay, the average student
with at least 26 books at home achieved minimum
computer and information literacy, equivalent to Level 2,
while those with fewer books at home scored an average
of 60 points less on the ICILS scale (Figure 5.7).
Various surveys expose low levels of skills related to
misinformation and online safety. In Singapore, a market
research agency survey of adults found that although
80% of respondents expressed confidence in detecting
fake news, 91% misidentified at least one fake news
story as real (Huiwen, 2018). The United Kingdom’s
communications regulator found that 72% of 12- to
15-year-olds were aware of the concept of fake news,
but only 40% said that they had ever seen something
online that they thought was a fake news story (Ofcom,
2022). Learners also need skills to critically evaluate
how information is generated. For example, according to
the OECD’s 2018 Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA), no more than 47% of 15-year-old
students could distinguish facts from opinions in a text
(OECD, 2021).

The 2018 PISA study, which also evaluated student
responses to a scenario in which they received a
typical phishing email – an attempt to get recipients
to reveal personal information or install malicious
software – suggested that 14% of 15-year-olds in
participating education systems were at risk of being
misled, ranging from 4% in Japan to 25% or more in Chile,
Hungary and Mexico. Just 5% of those with the strongest
reading skills on the PISA scale reported they would click
the link, compared to 24% of those with the weakest
reading skills (Jerim, 2023). This is a critical finding: basic
skills such as literacy and numeracy also prepare people to
better navigate a digital environment.

DIGITAL SKILLS ARE ACQUIRED
IN FORMAL EDUCATION AND OUTSIDE IT
Formal skills training is only one way of acquiring digital
skills and may not even be the main one, as indicated by
inequality in digital skills by individual characteristics,
such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, education and
occupation, social capital and health (Helsper and Eynon,
2013). There is remarkably little evidence on how digital
skills are acquired considering there are not only multiple
pathways but also multiple outcomes.

99

C H A P T E R 5 • D igital skills

In 2011, as part of the EU ICT household survey, individuals
reported the ways in which they had obtained such skills.
This question has not been asked since and remains,
even though out of date, a rare source of comparative
information. The answers showed that about one quarter
of adults in EU member states, ranging from 16% in Italy to
40% in Sweden, had acquired skills through a ‘formalized
educational institution (school, college, university, etc.)’.
A less formal route, such as training courses and adult
education centres, selected either by the person's own
initiative or employer demand, was used by half as many
adults. By contrast, informal learning, such as self-study,
or informal assistance from colleagues, relatives and
friends, was used on average by twice as many adults
(Figure 5.8).
Social media platforms, whose monthly active users
reached 4.7 billion in 2021 (OECD, 2022), help people
communicate as well as pursue personal projects,
encouraging them along the way to develop production,
web hosting and social networking skills. Children develop
coding and programming skills through digital games,
commercially available robotic kits and puzzle-style
digital applications. For instance, millions of students
worldwide have established foundational programming
skills, computational skills, and an interest in computer
science subjects with the help of Code.org, a non-profit
organization (Ali and Recep, 2021). People have developed
digital literacy skills in public libraries and community
centres. In Chile, between 2002 and 2017, the national
digital literacy campaign was based on the programme
BiblioRedes, a public library network (Chile National
System of Public Libraries, 2017). In rural Sri Lanka,
the e-Library Nenasala Program provided visitors to public
libraries and religious community centres with access to
computers and the internet (Andree, 2015).
This does not suggest that formal education is not
important for obtaining digital skills. Indeed, those who
have completed more formal education are better placed
to continue with their education, including informally.
In 2018, those with tertiary education in Europe were twice
as likely (18%) as those with upper secondary education
(9%) to engage in free online training or self-study to
improve their computer, software or application use skills
(Figure 5.9). Moreover, a solid mastery of literacy and
numeracy skills is positively associated with mastery
of at least some digital skills, for instance, media and
information literacy.

It is important to note that a preference for non-formal
or informal approaches to acquiring digital skills does not
ensure a higher level of competency. The easy accessibility
of internet applications and resources makes self-directed
learning convenient, but may mislead people to believe that
learning outcomes are guaranteed. This approach has been
labelled ‘laborious, frustrating, inefficient, and ineffective’
(van Dijk and van Deursen, 2014 p. 113). While analysis
of PIAAC problem-solving skills in technology-rich
environments showed a positive correlation between
participation in non-formal learning and ICT skills, most of
this association was driven by the selection of more skilled
individuals for specific training (Ehlert et al., 2021).

The challenge of non-formal learning affects both young
and older people. In Spain, a survey of female university
students showed they preferred self-directed (81%)
and collaborative approaches to acquire digital skills
(e.g. 65% talked to an expert for advice) over structured
courses, which were selected by one third of respondents.
But only 23% of those who relied on self-directed learning
and 35% of those who relied on collaborative learning
were assessed to have advanced skills, compared to
71% of those who intensively followed a structured course
(Jiménez-Cortés et al., 2017). Similar conclusions were
reached on the effectiveness of formal and non-formal
education courses for elderly learners in Belgium: support
provided by family and friends may motivate them,
but often comes at the cost of constraints in terms of time,
patience and expertise (Geerts et al., 2023).

It is a mistake to think that people pick up
digital skills effortlessly

101

C H A P T E R 5 • D igital skills

It is a mistake to think that people pick up digital skills
effortlessly. Familiarizing oneself with digital technology
is essential, but regular access to technology, support
networks and opportunities to apply such skills in
relevant ways are just as important, especially for those
from disadvantaged backgrounds (Eynon and Geniets,
2016). In India, analysis of secondary school students in
the 2017/18 National Sample Survey showed that students
with a computer at home were far more likely to report
being able to use a computer (89%) than those without
one (36%). There was some evidence that more computers
at secondary schools had a mild positive effect,
compensating for the absence of computers at home
(Bhandari et al., 2021).

5

However, material resources are only part of the challenge
for formal education systems. There are also questions
about the kind of content, pedagogy and outcomes that
best help develop digital skills, especially given the rapid
evolution of technology. Formal education systems tend
to focus on specialized skills; however, these may be
superficial, require time for teacher training and curricula
preparation, quickly become obsolete, and may ultimately
be less effective in helping navigate the digital world than
general skills (OECD, 2019a). In addition, formal education
systems – teachers in particular – need to accept, value
and integrate the experience and knowledge students
have acquired outside school, ‘looking in more depth at
the complex and diverse reality of children’s digital literacy
practices to better understand the skills, knowledge and
understanding they are developing’ (Grant, 2010 p. 17).

COUNTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED VARIOUS
WAYS TO BUILD DIGITAL SKILLS
Countries’ digital skills policies, plans and strategies are
developing rapidly. Some adopt a broad view of digital
skills, and some focus on a narrow set of technical skills.
Others take an intergenerational approach, while others
still specifically target particular groups, such as children
or parents (Box 5.1), or education levels. National examples
related to five key competence areas are useful in
illustrating the various ways in which countries are
building digital skills.
These policies tend to be directed at primary and
secondary education, although policies have also been
adopted in technical and vocational education and
training (TVET), and in higher education. The Ministry
of Education and Higher Education of Lebanon included
digital skills in the National Qualifications Framework,
and in the 2018–22 National Strategic Framework for
TVET (ILO, 2018; Lebanon Ministry of Education and Higher
Education, 2019). In Zambia, the Technical Education,
Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority
(TEVETA) has established a platform that offers free
digital skill courses targeted at youth, women, refugees,
as well as micro, small and medium enterprises.
(Zambia TEVETA, 2023). Cambodia has introduced
digital scholarships into the digital skills framework of
its 2022 EduTech Roadmap, to help higher education
students practise professionalism and solid research
skills when using digital resources (Cambodia Ministry
of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, 2022).
In India, the National Education Policy 2020 envisages
the mandatory curricular integration of the digital skills
required for artificial intelligence and machine learning in
higher education (India Ministry of Education, 2020).

B OX 5. 1:

Parents need to be involved in improving
children’s digital skills
With technology changing so rapidly, parents may not be
aware of the opportunities and risks from using technology.
In South Africa, parents had higher digital skills than their
children until their children reached 12 years of age. By age 15,
children surpassed their parents’ digital skills
(Byrne et al., 2016). Parents therefore need help to guide their
older children in online experiences.
Some parents feel they need to be more competent with
technology to be involved in their child’s technology activities
(Schneider et al., 2015). Others use a variety of devices,
mobile applications or parental controls (e.g. content filtering
software, internet blockers, add-on monitoring software) to
monitor children's whereabouts online and offline. A survey
of adults in 19 countries with at least one child aged between
7 and 12 suggests that nearly half of parents use parental
control applications to enforce limits on digital behaviour
and 45% check their child’s digital history (Kaspersky, 2021).
One approach that parents use to control their child’s use of
devices is ‘contracts’ to promote shared responsibility (Zhao
and Healy, 2022).
Governments try to respond to the lack of parents’ digital skills,
their overprotective and technologically moderated parenting,
and low engagement in developing their children’s digital skills.
Various policy documents emphasize the role of parents and
caregivers in protecting children’s privacy, personal data and
online reputation and the need to respect the confidentiality of
their correspondence (Council of Europe, 2018).
The Digi-Matua programme, a collaboration between New
Zealand’s Ministry of Education and the 360 Tautua Trust,
supports parents from Pacific communities to acquire
the digital skills necessary to support their children’s
education. Parents receive a digital device equipped with
10 modules, covering various topics including essential
functions such as charging devices, and more complex
subjects, such as internet safety, and proficiency with Google
applications (Aotearoa Education Gazette, 2022). Bhutan’s
2019–2023 iSherig-2 Education ICT Master Plan aims to
enhance parents’ capability to guide their children in the safe
and productive use of technology. Senegal’s Programme
for the Improvement of Quality, Equity and Transparency in
Education and Training 2018–2030 aims to better involve
parents in monitoring their children’s digital skills through
mobile phones.

An important question is the extent to which media
literacy in curricula is explicitly connected to critical
thinking in subject disciplines. In Georgia, according
to the 2018–24 National Curriculum, media literacy
is a cross-cutting competence, aimed at developing
students’ skills of filtering and critically assessing received
information. The New School Model, part of a larger scale
education reform introduced in 2018, aims to create a
critical thinking educational environment, including
through media literacy projects to develop resources,
promote creativity, and use media properly. Support
groups have been established to help schools develop
curricula (Basilaia and Danelia, 2022).

Japan

Overall, media literacy is embedded more in language,
arts, and humanities, including civic education, while data
literacy is found more in scientific subjects. Language is the
preferred medium for the development of both data and
media literacy skills in Japan, where more than 60% of the
curriculum covers these two competencies. By contrast,
language accounts for only about 5% of the curriculum in
Israel (Figure 5.10b).

The OECD Education 2030 Curriculum Content Mapping of
16 education systems showed that they have all included
media and data literacy in secondary education, albeit to
varying degrees. Among the systems compared, Greece
and Portugal dedicated the lowest percentage of the
curriculum to data and media literacy (less than 10%)
while Estonia and the Republic of Korea embedded those
competencies into half of their curricula (Figure 5.10a).

Data and information literacy skills enable people to
effectively browse, search, filter, evaluate and manage
data and information available in digital environments.
Some frameworks focus on media as a key source of
information, as its complexity has increased in the
digital era alongside threats of misinformation and
disinformation. UNESCO has published and updated
resources on media and information literacy, including
curricula and assessment frameworks (UNESCO,
2013, 2022).

INFORMATION AND DATA LITERACY

5

Media and information literacy has become prominent
in European education policy in recent years
(Drotner et al., 2017; European Audiovisual Observatory,
2016). Finland’s New Literacy Programme aims to
strengthen media literacy skills from early childhood
through to lower secondary education. Italy’s National
Digital School Plan integrates media literacy based on
the right to access the internet. Czechia introduced it as
a compulsory cross-curricular subject in the early 2000s
but implementation has not been strong as the
responsibility for providing training and resources
was transferred to non-governmental organizations
(Jirák and Zezulkova, 2019).
Despite calls by several government leaders in
sub-Saharan Africa to counter the spread of false
information through schools, a review of seven
countries showed no follow-up in education; any
actions taken were almost exclusively banning false
information by law (Cunliffe-Jones et al., 2021). South
Africa does include media literacy in secondary school
subjects such as life orientation, English, technology and
history (Wasserman and Madrid-Morales, 2022), while
the Western Cape province introduced a programme
focusing on misinformation in grades 8 to12
(Cunliffe-Jones et al., 2021).
Some countries take a protectionist approach to media
literacy which prioritizes information control over
education. As a result, media literacy is not mainstreamed
in school curricula, teachers are not trained, and efforts
are limited to resource development. In 2016, the Thai
Digital Economy and Society Ministry commissioned
Mahidol University to develop a digital literacy curriculum
and lesson plans for classrooms, which includes
aspects of understanding and accessing digital media
(UNESCO Bangkok, 2020). In the Philippines,
the Association for Media and Information Literacy
advocated for the incorporation of media and information
literacy in the curriculum, which has now become a core
subject in grades 11 and 12 (Frau-Meigs, 2023).
Media literacy receives much attention in Latin America but
efforts are scattered and led by civil society, with limited
streamlining of media literacy in education (Garro-Rojas,
2020). There is also a general perception that the focus
on digital skills in education systems in the region is not
combined with digital media literacy (Mateus et al., 2020).
More than 50% of 15-year-old students in the 2018 PISA
reported that they were trained at school to recognize
biased information. Australia, Canada, Denmark and the
United States had the highest coverage (more than 70%)
and Israel, Latvia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland

the lowest (less than 45%) (OECD, 2021). Media literacy
education targeting disinformation is also unevenly
distributed within countries. Students from privileged
socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to be taught
how to detect biased information than their peers from
disadvantaged backgrounds (Suarez-Alvarez, 2021).
Evidence on the effectiveness of current programmes
is mixed. The 2018 PISA found students who had
received any education at all about online dangers,
including a specific question about phishing emails,
were no less likely to believe that clicking the link in the
phishing email and providing their personal data would
be an appropriate response (Jerim, 2023). In contrast,
the percentage of students who could correctly distinguish
facts from opinions, even after accounting for their
reading performance, was higher in education systems
where more students had been taught how to recognize
subjective or biased information (OECD, 2021).
COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION
Digital skills in communication and collaboration are
critical in the context of advanced digital connectivity
and the increasing prevalence of hybrid learning
arrangements. Such skills are instrumental in facilitating
the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, fostering
innovation, streamlining learning and work processes,
and understanding ethical digital behaviours.
Countries adopt varied strategies to promote
communication and collaboration skills in schools.
Argentina promoted skills and competencies related
to teamwork and knowledge sharing, as part of a
digital platform to organize programming and robotics
competitions for primary and secondary school students
(Ripani and Vazquez-Brust, 2023). Mexico’s Digital
Education Agenda and National Agreement on Education
promote citizen participation through digital technologies,
social use of digital learning resources and communication,
and research, innovation and creativity in digital education
(Mexico Secretariat of Public Education, 2020). A new
digital platform, the New Mexican School, offers teachers
and students digital educational resources and tools for
remote collaboration, peer learning and knowledge sharing
(Ripani and Vazquez-Brust, 2023).
Ethical digital behaviour, also called ‘netiquette’, refers
to the set of ethical rules, politeness, conventions and
standards that should be learned, understood and
practised by digital users while communicating on and
using digital spaces. Factors such as anonymity, invisibility,
asynchronicity and minimization of authority make it
difficult for individuals to understand and experience the

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

104

5

complexities of digital communication. University students
often violate etiquette boundaries when communicating
online, both with each other and with professors
(Galimullina et al., 2022). In Jordan, university students
share a consensus on the general rules of netiquette
but have limited knowledge of the different levels of
implementation and limited practice of netiquette related
to critical thinking skills (Arouri and Hamaidi, 2017).
Higher education institutions are offering courses.
In Scotland, United Kingdom, the University of Edinburgh
has developed a structured learning path to enable
students to communicate effectively and ethically in
digital media and spaces, participate in digital teams and
working groups, and build digital networks (University of
Edinburgh, 2023). In Canada, the Southern Alberta Institute
of Technology offers a digital communication course for
students to enhance their understanding of various digital
communication and collaboration strategies, tools and
formats, encouraging students to consider technology
ethics, purpose and discipline in the use of collaborative
technology (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology,
2022).
DIGITAL CONTENT CREATION
Competences in digital content creation include selecting
appropriate delivery formats and creating copy, audio,
video and visual assets; integrating digital content; and
respecting copyright and licences. Young people need to
be encouraged to be active participants in digital content
creation, making effective use of the digital environment.
From an economic perspective, the ubiquitous use of social
media has elevated the value of creating content as a skill
with direct application in electronic commerce
(Dwivedi et al., 2021).
Countries have developed various responses to the
development of content creation skills. Indonesia has
updated its national primary and secondary education
curricula, eliminating ICT as a stand-alone compulsory
subject. The 2013 curriculum concentrates on high-order
thinking skills, including analysis, evaluation and
creation, through integrating ICT into other subjects
(SMERU Research Institute, 2022). As part of its
National Movement for Digital Literacy, involving more
than 60 national-level institutions and communities,
the Siberkreasi platform counts collaborative engagement
among its core activities. Intellectual property rights
webinars for young content creators are one of several
interventions (Siberkreasi, 2023). Indonesia Makin Cakap
Digital (Raising Indonesia’s Digital Capability), an initiative
between Siberkreasi and the government, aims to improve
digital media ethics, safety, capability and culture in

105

C H A P T E R 5 • D igital skills

content creation. The initiative involves public figures, such
as artists, to inspire students and foster wider community
cooperation in producing and disseminating ethical
digital content to enhance the digital culture pillar of the
2020–2024 Indonesia Digital Literacy Roadmap (Literasi
Digital, 2023).
In Jordan, the Youth, Technology and Jobs project of
the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship
(2020–25) provides digital skills professional programmes
to 30,000 youth and women and offers to create
10,000 new jobs for youth, including women and Syrian
refugees, who are active in the areas of digital freelance
and content creation work (Jordan Ministry of Digital
Economy and Entrepreneurship, 2023).
In Malaysia, the Ministry of Education in collaboration
with public, private and academic actors launched the
#mydigitalmaker movement, which encourages students
to acquire digital content creation skills, focusing on
programming, robotics and digital design to establish
the country as a leading digital content creator and
provider in the region by 2030. It has reached more
than two million students nationwide (Malaysia Economic
Planning Unit, 2021). Under its umbrella, the Digital Ninja
programme offers bootcamps for secondary school
students to gain industry and work experience alongside
digital technology professionals in content creation,
certifying more than 500 students (Malaysia Digital
Economy Corporation, 2023).
In some upper-middle- and high-income countries,
advanced content creation skills, especially related to
intellectual property rights, are mainly offered in higher
education. Analysis of the syllabi of bachelor’s and
master’s courses in 36 universities in Canada, China,
Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United
States found almost 90% of universities offering courses
with copyright content (Fernández-Molina et al., 2022).
The development of copyright education is also emerging in
sub-Saharan Africa. Intellectual property rights education
is scheduled in curricula in schools and universities in
Namibia (Namibia Ministry of Industrialization, Trade
and SME Development, 2019) and Rwanda (Rwanda
Ministry of Trade and Industry, 2018). The Kenya Copyright
Board, established under the Copyright Act, collaborates
closely with universities to provide copyright education
and conducts frequent training sessions for students,
particularly in visual arts and ICT (KECOBO, 2023).

Empowering students to stay safe, be
responsible online and make smart choices
are important policy priorities

SAFETY
The digital environment increases exposure to key risks:
cybersecurity and violation of privacy through data
misuse; the mental and physical health implications of
issues including lengthy screen time and cyberbullying;
and harmful content, with the potential long-term impact
on addictive behaviour, violence and sexual exploitation.
Empowering students to stay safe, be responsible online
and make smart choices are therefore important policy
priorities (Chapter 8).
Education systems need to strengthen preventative
measures and respond to many challenges from
passwords to permissions, enabling members of the
education community to understand the implications of
their online presence and digital footprint. Brazil’s National
Common Curricular Base for Basic Education recognizes
schools should develop understanding and the use of
digital ICT in a critical, meaningful, reflective and safe way
as one of the essential skills (Brazil Ministry of Education,
2019). More than 50% of schools included elements of
safe, responsible and critical internet use in the content of
several subjects, although only 29% conducted debates or
lectures on privacy and data protection (CETIC, 2020).
In terms of cybersecurity, Ghana announced an intention
to include this as part of its curricula in primary and
secondary schools (FAAPA, 2019), but implementation has
lagged behind; some schools run cybersecurity clubs but
few young people join them (Digital Rights, 2022). As part
of its 2017–2020 Education and Sports Sector Strategic
Plan, Uganda incorporated systems and data security into
the national ICT curriculum in lower secondary education
(Uganda National Curriculum Development Centre, 2019).
Qatar’s National Cyber Security Agency and the Ministry
of Education and Higher Education launched the Cyber
Security Educational Curriculum in 2023 to enhance
responsible, ethical and safe use of ICT, raise awareness
of general concepts related to cybersecurity and digital
safety, and foster education about the internet and data
protection risks (John, 2023). In New Zealand, the Te Mana
Tūhono (Power of Connectivity) programme delivers digital
protection and security services to almost 2,500 state and
state-integrated schools (Network for Learning, 2022).

Cyberbullying takes various forms, such as the deliberate
publication of photos or videos of individuals without their
consent (Myers and Cowie, 2019), exclusion from digital
groups (OECD, 2017), verbal violence (Zhu et al., 2021)
and insults and threats (Cebollero-Salinas et al., 2022).
Many countries’ policies on technology in education are
responding with awareness-raising, reporting mechanisms
and digital risk interventions, usually at the school level.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions
in selected, mostly high-income countries estimated that
the average programme has a 73% chance of reducing
cyberbullying victimization (Polanin et al., 2022).
Access to digital technology and the internet means
children can access harmful content, and school-based
and other initiatives are urgently needed to protect them.
In Wales, United Kingdom, the government has advised
schools how to prepare for and respond to harmful viral
online content and hoaxes. Guidance includes talking to
learners about reporting, blocking and peer pressure, while
resources aim to minimize the risk for learners of viewing
offensive content (Wales Government, 2023).
After a curriculum review in 2020/21, Australia integrated
privacy and security in the updated curriculum from
preschool to grade 10 in eight subjects (ACARA, 2021).
The eSafety Commissioner provides information on
application features that can increase exposure to content
risks and equips teachers with resources to tackle the
issue (Australia eSafety Commissioner, 2023). New Zealand
has mandated the inclusion of critical thinking in the
curriculum for grades 1 to 13 to help students understand
that working with data comes with responsibility for
ensuring security and privacy. Up to 80% of 15-year-old
students report learning these concepts at school
(New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2022).
PROBLEM-SOLVING
The definition of problem-solving skills varies widely
among education systems worldwide. In its definition,
the DigComp framework includes solving technical
problems when operating devices and assessing needs,
and when identifying, evaluating, selecting, using and
adjusting digital tools. But problem-solving is usually
understood more broadly, as an approach to learning
which argues that understanding should be through a
process of solving problems, not teaching students how
to understand.
Accordingly, many countries define problem-solving
in terms of coding and programming – and as part of
computer science in the curriculum, which may include
elements of computational thinking, the use of
algorithms and automation (Passey, 2017).

A global review estimated that 43% of students
in high-income, 62% in upper-middle-income,
5% in lower-middle-income countries, but no students
in low-income countries take computer science as
compulsory in primary and/or secondary education
(Vegas et al., 2021). This translates into 20% of education
systems mandating that schools offer computer science
as an elective or required course; 7% offering it in some
schools and subnational jurisdictions, and the rest at best
only offering pilot programmes (Vegas and Fowler, 2020).
Countries with mandatory computer science education are
clustered in Eastern Europe and East Asia. Central Asia,
South-eastern Asia and Latin America are the regions
outside Europe and North America that have implemented

or piloted computer education on the most extensive scale
(Vegas et al., 2021) (Box 5.2).
In Hong Kong, China, the Education Bureau’s
2020 curriculum guidance recommends 10 to 14 hours
annually of problem-solving education in upper primary
grades through a stand-alone class or integration into
other subjects (Hong Kong Education Bureau, 2020).
An evaluation of CoolThink@JC, a project launched in
2016 by a private charity in collaboration with leading
universities and the Education Bureau, which has reached
87% of publicly funded schools (CoolThink@JC, 2023),
showed a significant impact on students’ problem-solving
practices (Shear et al., 2020). In Singapore, problem-solving

B OX 5.2:

Computer science is mostly taught as a compulsory subject in Latin America
A review of seven Latin American countries for this report found that most have included or plan to include computer science as a subject
in primary or secondary education and change it from an elective into a compulsory subject. The focus on computer science responds
to the need to make curricula more relevant. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay are also driven by the need to increase
employability and address labour market demand.
Computer science is generally treated as a stand-alone subject. Costa Rica was the first to introduce computer science in school in the
late 1980s. The informatics programme was gradually scaled up and its content updated to reflect notions of computer science. Students
in Chile and Cuba study computer science as part of informatics and technology courses, respectively. In 2022, a curriculum reform
in Brazil introduced computer science as a compulsory and independent subject across all education levels. By contrast, in Uruguay,
computer science is integrated into mathematics, language, arts and science in primary schools, and studied as an independent subject in
the first year of secondary education.
Teaching and learning computer science in Latin America differs by content and by education level. With the exception of Paraguay, all
seven countries reviewed teach algorithms and programming in primary and secondary schools. Argentina, Brazil and Costa Rica also
include these concepts in pre-primary schools. Computer architecture and hardware are taught in most primary schools, whereas artificial
intelligence is taught in secondary programmes in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Safety is taught to primary students in Chile and Uruguay
and to primary and secondary students in Brazil.
Argentina has standards at the federal level for programming skills to be integrated in compulsory education through a projectbased teaching methodology. In Colombia, the 2019 National Strategy Coding for Kids has reached more than 4,000 schools and
464,000 primary and secondary students. Paraguay’s 2022 STEAM National Plan incorporates video gaming competitions to increase
engagement and facilitate primary and secondary students' learning of programming and coding constructs.
In most countries, non-state actors have advocated for and implemented computer science education. The Sadosky Foundation in
Argentina, Korea Foundation in Chile, Omar Dengo Foundation in Costa Rica and Plan Ceibal Foundation in Uruguay have worked closely
with ministries to initiate computer science education, developing teaching materials and providing in-service teacher training. The
Centre for Innovation in Education in Brazil and the Brazilian Computer Association informed policy dialogue around the need to include
computer science education in curriculum standards across all education levels.
Implementation challenges persist, especially in relation to ensuring the delivery of computer science in all schools in a country,
except in Costa Rica. Within decentralized systems, as for example in Argentina and Brazil, the implementation of computer science
programmes has varied. Gaps in the availability of teaching and learning materials, in teacher preparation and in adequate infrastructure
have hampered the scaling-up of programmes. Schools serving remote, indigenous and other disadvantaged populations have usually
lagged behind.

skills involve breaking down complex problems into
smaller, more manageable components and designing
algorithms to solve them. The 2021 secondary education
computing syllabus includes a dedicated module divided
into problem analysis and algorithm design
(Singapore Ministry of Education, 2021). In the
United Arab Emirates, problem-solving skills are defined
as the ability to think logically, algorithmically and
recursively and write computer code and programmes
to solve problems, and are integrated into computational
thinking, computer practice, and programming in
its Computer Science and Technology Standards
(United Arab Emirates Ministry of Education, 2015).
Kenya has become the first African country to incorporate
coding as a subject in primary and secondary schools
under the new competency-based curriculum (Kinyajnui,
2022). The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development has
approved a coding skills curriculum developed by Kodris
Africa, a for-profit company, for children aged 7 to 16 in the
Python programming language that focuses on algorithms,
debugging and logical operators (Kodris, 2023).
Introducing coding for young children is considered
difficult because of competition with other curricular
priorities, but it can address equity issues (Trucano,
2015) and gender-based stereotypes (Sullivan, 2019)
that affect the development of these skills. In Spain,
the 2020 Education Law emphasizes problem-solving
and computational thinking skills as a cross-curriculum
topic starting from the earliest education levels
(Spain Ministry of Education and Vocational Training,
2022). Problem-solving content has been integrated into
primary education mathematics in the Navarra region,
and in robotics and programming subjects in primary and
secondary education in the Madrid and Catalonia regions
(Spain Ministry of Education and Vocational Training,
2018).

science and with the University of Chile to develop
teaching pathways and assessment instruments
(Ripani and Vazquez-Brust, 2023).

CONCLUSION
The development of digital technology has generated
an urgent demand for skills to navigate its opportunities
and risks. While there is consensus that digital skills have
become part of a basic skills set that formal education
systems should deliver, there is confusion over which
basic elements a digital skills set should contain – as well
as the degree to which these skills are general or specific,
their purpose and the definitions of many of these skills
and overlaps between them. It is also uncertain if formal
education systems have the capacity to keep up with the
pace of change, and which of these skills are best acquired
through non-formal and informal learning.
Countries are faced with critical decisions over the range
of skills to include in their curricula, how to integrate them
and package them in subjects, at what level, and how to
leverage the experience of learners, which often surpasses
that of their teachers. Given the low levels of digital skills
in the global population and the ever-increasing complexity
of the digital world, countries need to urgently define
digital skills and decide how best to increase them among
their citizens.

Non-state actors often support the inclusion in curricula
of coding and programming skills, including computer
science. In England, United Kingdom, Computing at
School, a non-profit organization, developed a computing
programme which has been helping children as young as
five to learn to code (Humphreys, 2021). Following strong
advocacy from Code.org, all 50 governors in the
United States signed on to the Governors’ Compact
to expand computer science education, committing to
increase the number of schools offering it, allocate
more funding, create post-secondary career pathways
and increase participation from traditionally underserved
populations (National Governors Association, 2022).
In Chile, Code.org has partnered with the government

find themselves collecting data with one application but being unable, unless they spend more, to link them with
other data collected with a different application.

Too often there is a distance between technology's expected benefits for education management and their

O

ne implication of digital technology is that education
systems have begun producing enormous amounts
of data. This growth matches the trend in global data
production, whose volume is projected to double as soon
as 2025 from the estimated 97 zettabytes generated
globally in 2022 (McLean, 2022), where a zettabyte is
the equivalent of a trillion gigabytes. As the volume of
the data produced expands, management tasks and
functions accumulate. And, as systems grow in size and
complexity, more demands are placed on administrators,
who are expected to set and monitor a higher number of
quantitative education targets. With the decentralization
of education management, the number of actors involved
multiplies. Each level of education management, from
the ministry to the classroom, has to follow specific new
data requirements, processes and uses. These uses move
from individual devices to digital ecosystems, and the
assumption is that by facilitating data processing and
exchange, technology can improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of education system management to help realize
policy objectives.

decision making in education. Yet as the ability to handle
and leverage these data becomes more important
(Howard et al., 2022), capacity is often absent and data are
not used as often, effectively or efficiently (Custer et al.,
2018; Rossiter, 2020).
This chapter discusses how technology supports education
management while also creating new challenges, both
at the system and at the school level. Technology is not
a magic wand: it cannot solve problems that are not of
a technological nature. Instead, it needs to be seen as
playing a part in management systems alongside people,
models, methods, processes, procedures, rules and
regulations. For this reason, systems are often unprepared
to integrate technologies.

TECHNOLOGY CAN SUPPORT THE
MANAGEMENT OF LARGE VOLUMES OF
EDUCATION INFORMATION

Effectiveness refers to how well functions are performed,
such as storage and retrieval of information, assessment
of learning levels and hiring of staff. Efficiency refers to
the optimization of financial, human and time resources
allocated to perform tasks, to which technology can
contribute substantially through automating series of
commands and functions, removing the need for manual
inputs. By enabling the use of information, technology can
improve the quality of analytical insights that feed into

Education management information systems organize
and perform ‘the collection, integration, processing,
maintenance and dissemination of data and information to
support decision making, policy analysis and formulation,
planning, monitoring and management at all levels of an
education system’ (Cassidy, 2006 p. 27). Critical functions
include keeping track of flows and stocks of learners
and their performance to ensure that commensurate
and equitable resources are allocated across the system
(Broadband Commission Working Group on Data for
Learning, 2022; UNESCO and GPE, 2020).

As the ability to handle and leverage data
becomes more important, capacity is often
absent and data are not used as often,
effectively or efficiently

Education management information systems are evolving
in many countries in response to changes in public sector
management that have seen a more business-oriented
focus on efficiency and effectiveness. Such reforms have
been characterized by increased school autonomy, target
setting and results-based performance (Verger and Curran,

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

6

2014), all of which require more data. By one measure,
since the 1990s, the number of policies making references
to data, statistics and information has increased by
13 times in high-income, 9 times in upper-middle-income
and 5 times in low- and lower-middle-income countries
(Bromley et al., 2023).
The types and sources of data used by education
management information systems are diversifying.
Digital technology can support efforts for improving the
integration, availability, sharing, frequency and granularity
of data (Amuha et al., 2023). Data integration involves
processes and standards to unify access to data from
multiple and autonomous sources (Srivastava and Dong,
2015). In education, such integration unifies data on
students (enrolment, attendance and examination results,
disaggregated by individual characteristics), teachers (age,
qualifications and professional development), and schools
(infrastructure and resources).
In many countries, strategies to develop education
management information systems focus on data
integration. The Brunei Darussalam Integrated National
Education Information System uses a common platform
for data on admission, attendance, curriculum, results,
school resources, student allowances and scholarships
(Ibrahim et al., 2020). Malaysia’s education information
ecosystem includes about 350 systems and applications
scattered across institutions. In 2017, the country
introduced its Education Data Repository as part of the
ICT Transformation Plan 2019–2023. By 2019, it had
integrated 12 of its main data systems, aiming for full
integration through a single data platform by the end of
2023 (UNICEF, 2019). In Sri Lanka, the National Policy
on Preschool Education foresees the development of an
integrated education management information system
as a way to improve preschool registration, monitoring,
analysis, planning and use of data for decision making,
as well as a way to harmonize procedures, indicators
and data across provinces (Sri Lanka National Education
Commission, 2019).
In Latin America, the countries of Argentina, Chile and
Mexico have systems that integrate data on infrastructure,
learning assessments and educational improvement. Brazil
links budget and expenditure data with learning outcome
data. Uruguay’s platform integrates student data including
variables related to disability, ethnicity, race, migration and
location (UNESCO, 2021b).
Two elements are key in fostering the development of
such integrated data systems for education management:
unique identifiers and interoperability (Abdul-Hamid, 2017;
UNESCO, 2022).

UNIQUE STUDENT IDENTIFICATION IS NOT USED
ENOUGH TO UNLOCK TECHNOLOGY’S POTENTIAL
Guaranteeing that each school and student is uniquely
identified within an education management information
system is key to the effective and efficient use of
information. It allows students to be followed in school
registers, examination records and national scholarship
databases throughout their education journey for
administrative routine follow-up and for analytical insights
into their learning trajectories. It has benefits beyond
education – for example, student identification can be
linked to civil registry official digital identification, which
can then link to other social services.

Student identification can be linked to civil
registry official digital identification, which can
then link to other social services
School identification is universal (e.g. 93% of countries
outside Western Europe and North America have
school identification numbers in secondary education)
and supported by geographic information systems
(Box 6.1), although coverage is somewhat more limited for
early childhood education and for technical and vocational
education centres (72% of countries each). But only 54% of
countries – and as few as 22% of sub-Saharan African
countries – have put in place unique student identification
mechanisms. It was reported in 2020 that 34% of
countries – and 53% of sub-Saharan African countries –
had plans or were in the process of introducing student
identification numbers (UNESCO Institute for Statistics,
2020) (Figure 6.1).
Even though several African countries claim to have school
identification numbers, they are often not unique and can
vary between databases, such as between examination
result records and the school census, compromising links
and preventing optimal use. With support from UNICEF,
education ministries in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Zambia
devised an interim solution to match their school records.
A text similarity algorithm (Gomaa and Fahmy, 2013)
matched schools between databases using the degree of
likeness between text associated with each school, such as
its name or location. The process allowed 86% of schools
in Côte d’Ivoire and at least 87% of schools in Zambia to
be identified, helping analyse their performance between
2015 and 2020. In Ghana, some three quarters of schools
had their school census and Basic Education Certification
Examination records linked, enabling a detailed analysis
of factors influencing student examination performance
(UNICEF Innocenti – Global Office of Research and
Foresight, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c).

Geospatial data shed light on those in need of

Two key tools used to improve unique school identifiers are
geospatial data and the use of geographic information systems
(GIS). They can support decision makers as they address equity
and efficiency in infrastructure and resource distribution
in their education systems, including optimising teacher
allocation (Haßler et al., 2023). School mapping can be used to
foster diversity and reduce inequality of opportunity. Ireland,
for instance, links three databases that use GIS coordinates,
from the Central Statistical Office, the Department of Social
Protection and the Department of Education and Skills, to
decide in which of its 314 planning areas to build new schools
(European Commission, 2022).

Travel distance to school is an important determinant of school
participation (Das and Das, 2023). Countries have adopted
policies stating maximum travel distance or commute time to
base their school location decisions and ensure child safety
and well-being. In Switzerland, children should not walk
more than 1 kilometre if they are less than 5 years old and no
more than 2 kilometres if they are between 6 and 8 years old
(Schweizer and Regli, 2018).

B OX 6.1 C O N T I N U E D :
In England, United Kingdom, the statutory walking distances are 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) for children under age 8 and 3 miles
(4.8 kilometres) for children age 8 and above. The maximum recommended commute time is 45 minutes in primary and 75 minutes in
secondary education (Department for Education, 2014).
Geospatial data–based methods and tools can identify areas in which children live too far from the nearest school and estimate
compliance with age-appropriate travel distances set by governments. For instance, in Guatemala despite a well-balanced allocation of
schools across the country, it has been estimated that 5% of the population lived more than 3 kilometres away from a primary school in
2017. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the average distance to the closest primary school is 6 kilometres and 41% of the population
are estimated to lived more than 3 kilometres away from the nearest school (Rodriguez-Segura and Kim, 2021) (Figure 6.2). In the Indian
state of Uttar Pradesh, GIS data analysis has highlighted discrepancies between school catchment areas and maximum travel distances
for pupils, as well as equity-related issues such as disparities by gender or in the pupil/teacher ratio (Agrawal and Gupta, 2016).
Equity and efficiency are often competing policy objectives. In China, school mapping was used in the early 2000s to improve efficiency
in rural school distribution. Primary schools in small villages were merged or closed and replaced by boarding schools in the closest
township, the next higher administrative level. The policy improved the efficiency of government spending, but is also believed to have
increased the dropout rate in the short term among children from the poorest households living in the villages (Rao and Ye, 2016; Wang
and Lewin, 2016).
Geospatial data also help identify schools and child populations vulnerable to specific risks (Gagnon and Vargas Mesa, 2022). In Indonesia,
school mapping was used to identify schools in disaster-prone areas to prioritize risk reduction interventions and identify travel routes
to and from schools (Ariyanti et al., 2018). Sierra Leone has developed a GIS tool that considers new school locations based on poverty,
population and flood risk data. Geospatial data are also used to decide which schools to renovate, expand with additional classrooms, and
equip with water and sanitation facilities (Vijil-Morin et al., 2023).
Despite the potential of geospatial data to lead to more equitable school and resource distribution decisions, their use remains nascent
in low- and lower-middle-income countries, where they are most needed (Vijil-Morin et al., 2023). The use of geospatial data is often
limited to small projects led by development agencies or researchers with the technical and financial capacity to handle such data.

For many countries, student identification is relatively
recent. Albania is developing Socrates, an education
management information system that will introduce
unique identifiers through which students will be
monitored from their entry into the formal school system
until the end of upper secondary (Maghnouj et al., 2020).
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the West Herzegovina Canton
is developing a new system to support planning in which
student and teacher identification numbers will be
introduced and linked to their respective administrative
identification numbers (Guthrie et al., 2022). Serbia’s
2017 Act on the Foundations of the Education System
envisaged the same action (Donnelly, 2021; ITU and
UNICEF, 2021).
In South Africa, the Learner Unit Record Tracking System
has been in place since 2010 and covers all public schools
(South Africa Department of Basic Education, 2012; van
Wyk, 2015). All learners are uniquely identified with a
number, and their individual data are recorded until grade
12, including when they move between schools and
provinces. The number is interoperable (i.e. compatible)

115

C H A P T E R 6 • E ducation management

with the South African School Administration and
Management System, which is the national school
management and administration software (van Wyk,
2015). Since its introduction, the system has permitted
more advanced and robust analyses of repetition and
dropout patterns, learner trajectories and teacher
demand and supply (van der Berg et al., 2019, 2021, 2022).
However, the system still appears to sometimes assign a
second identification number to students who transfer to
a new school (van der Berg et al., 2021). UNICEF has been
implementing the Learner Unit Record Tracking System in
four northern Nigerian states (UNICEF, 2022).
Digital identification projects face various challenges.
In Ethiopia, the implementation of a digital identification
system for five million secondary school students is based
on blockchain technology. The system is a pilot for Ethiopia
to build a national digital identification system. It uses
Cardano, a public blockchain platform, as the foundation,
but the platform is vulnerable to major risks, from network
failures to privacy breaches (Renieris, 2021).

Student identification systems should be
developed carefully to avoid exclusion
Student identification systems should be developed
carefully to avoid exclusion. Digital national identification
systems are key for accelerating progress to universal
legal identification by 2030: currently, it is estimated
that 850 million, mostly marginalized, people do not have
legal proof of identification (World Bank, 2023). Access to
education, healthcare or social welfare may be conditional
on having national identification (Maikem, 2022; Mutung’u,
2021). Yet digital identification processes have been
shown to exclude populations from access to such services
(Center for Human Rights and Global Justice et al., 2021;
Privacy International, 2021). In India, the Supreme Court
ruled in 2018 that Aadhaar, the successful national digital
identity card, could not be made mandatory: not only
should alternative means of identity verification be made
available but children should be exempt. However, Aadhaar
continues to be routinely demanded from children for
enrolling in anganwadis (a type of rural childcare centre),
and schools, that may lead to their exclusion (Drèze and
Khera, 2022).
Refugee populations can be made vulnerable because of
digital identification. In Kenya, members of the Somali
minority have faced vetting and delays while applying for
identification. In some cases, this is because individuals
have previously registered with the UN High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) to access services, including
education, that were available to refugees at the time.
However, they were later barred from obtaining digital
identification cards when the government cross-checked
their applications against UNHCR data (Mutung’u, 2021;
Weitzberg, 2020; Yousif, 2018). The UNCHR has also
shared biometric, personal information data of Rohingya
refugees in Bangladesh with the Bangladeshi government,
which were then shared with the Myanmar government.
To protect marginalized communities, the collection
of biometric and other personal data needs to be
accompanied by informed consent on their use (Human
Rights Watch, 2021).
Social safety net programmes are also vulnerable to
weaknesses in identification systems. In Kenya, cash
transfer programmes started using electronic payment
mechanisms in 2013 based on two-factor identification:
a personal identification number and a national
identification card and/or a biometric fingerprint. This
posed a problem for households headed by children,
whose identity cards are only issued when they reach
18 (Mwasiaji, 2016). In Uganda, the Senior Citizens’

Grant is an unconditional cash transfer to all Ugandans
over 65. The grant has had an impact on child education
attainment, as 14% of beneficiaries spent part or all of
their cash on their grandchildren’s education (Kidd, 2017).
However, its effectiveness was impacted with the switch
to Ndaga Muntu, the Ugandan digital identification system,
which has been shown to exclude some populations.
Indeed, the poorest elderly are usually outside the formal
identification system as they cannot travel long distances
to fulfil the administrative requirements to obtain their
digital identification. Some were victims of system errors
in recording their age properly (Center for Human Rights
and Global Justice et al., 2021).
INFORMATION SYSTEMS OFTEN DO NOT
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
Interoperability, which includes the ability of databases
to communicate and work with one another, is becoming
a necessary condition to unlock the full potential of
education data for effective management (UNESCO,
2021a). Applications and software have multiplied to
respond to the increasing role played by education
data in management at all levels. As more vendors
enter the market, and as many procurement decisions
become decentralized, schools and universities often
find themselves collecting data in one area with one
software but being unable, unless they spend more,
to link them with data collected in another area with a
different software. Education is not the only sector facing
this problem: the lack of interoperability was recognized
20 years ago as a major challenge in the healthcare sector
(Walker et al., 2005).

Applications and software have multiplied
to respond to the increasing role played by
education data in management at all levels

In education, the Groningen Declaration, initially signed
by China, India, the Netherlands, Norway, the
Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Kingdom,
the United States and several European higher education
institutions (Groningen Declaration, 2012) now has more
than 110 signatories who have committed to foster and
improve digital student data to ensure the free movement
of students. A recent survey among universities in the
United Kingdom indicated that 43% of respondents
identified interoperability issues as highly problematic for
managing learning assessment data (Knight and Ferrell,
2022).

Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom
and the United States have developed systems
interoperability frameworks: each country has a defined
infrastructure, and specifications are made freely available
to all stakeholders and developers (Access 4 Learning
Community, 2022). In 2010, Australia introduced the
National Schools Interoperability Program to develop
common technical standards and projects that improve the
interoperability of information systems used by education
institutions (Education Services Australia, 2023a). A toolkit
helps test how administration authorities interact with
the National Assessment Platform, facilitates marking of
examinations, and supports institutions to process results
and produce learning assessment reports in compliance
with the requirements of each authority (Education
Services Australia, 2023b).

that describes assessments, diplomas, transcripts and
records for higher education institutions (EMREX, 2022;
EMREX and ERASMUS+, 2015). EMREX has set good
practice in the development of interoperability standards
based on openness and inclusion. Its code is open source
and standards development is governed by a user group
where all actors interested in improving student data
portability are represented and can vote (EMREX, 2022a).
The standard is subject to public scrutiny as it is neither
privately developed nor imposed through commercial
dissemination (Bollinger, 2000). EMREX is currently used
by higher education institutions in 10 European countries.
Still, it coexists with other standards, including Erasmus
Without Paper and Europass, which at times do not
communicate with each other (Fridell et al., 2022).

Particularly in these four countries, but also in a few
other high-income countries, demand for data has been
fuelled by sector performance monitoring, often within
the framework of accountability policies. Unprecedented
volumes of data are needed, not only for monitoring
whether schools meet standards but also to ascertain
whether student performance is improving over time.
In the mid-2010s, New Zealand recognized that schools
had been procuring student management systems
and related software independently, and that the
lack of interoperability between them, as well as with
other central databases, was preventing authorities
from tracking student progress (Hernandez, 2019;
New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2016). In 2019,
the government assigned the company CoreFour to deploy
its learning management system, Edsby, to develop the
Te Rito National Learner Repository and Data Exchange.
The project also intended to reduce the administrative
burden on teachers and improve the quality and timeliness
of data provided to the government. The data were to
be hosted in Microsoft-operated, Ministry-approved
cloud data centres (Edsby, 2019). However, deployment
was paused in 2021 due to cybersecurity concerns (New
Zealand Ministry of Education, 2022) and is to restart in
mid-2023 (New Zealand Ministry of Education, 2023).

TECHNOLOGY’S HUGE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM
LEARNING ASSESSMENT IS UNDERUTILIZED

European countries have been addressing interoperability
concerns collectively to facilitate data sharing between
countries and across multiple applications used in the
management of higher education enrolment, assessment,
learning, diplomas and certification. The EMREX project,
which emerged from an initial collaboration between
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, has fostered
student data portability as part of the Erasmus+
programme. It has supported degree and credit mobility
and the recognition of previous studies. The system
uses a set of common standards, including a data model

117

C H A P T E R 6 • E ducation management

Learning assessments used to be exclusively paper-based
and manually corrected, but are now increasingly
administered using technology, with substantial gains
in measurement precision, ease of administration and
sharing of results with learners and parents (United States
Office of Education Technology, 2015). Computer-based
assessments and computer adaptive testing have been
replacing many paper-based assessments (Chen, 2023).
Computer-based assessments are administered with the
use of a computer or a digital device (Wise, 2018). They
reduce test administration costs, improve measurement
quality and provide rapid scoring. It is also claimed that
by providing immediate feedback, they help teachers
individualize feedback and teaching (McClelland and
Cuevas, 2020; Moncaleano and Russell, 2018; Wise,
2018). However, the evidence on this is weak and, at least
in the United Kingdom, an impact on improving teaching
and learning has not been confirmed beyond early grade
reading and mathematics (See et al., 2022). Other benefits
of computer-based assessments include the potential to
support teachers to communicate with parents about their
children’s progress (Shute and Rahimi, 2017) and to reduce
opportunities for cheating by easily generating multiple
test versions, as is done in Indonesia (Dwiyono et al., 2021).
Computer-based approaches open vast opportunities
for both formative and summative assessment. They
expand the range of skills assessed – for example,
collaboration and creativity (OECD, 2017). They can go
beyond a simple analysis of correct answers to explain
how students respond to questions. For instance, they
can identify factors explaining learner performance, such
as confidence, enjoyment and cognitive engagement
with reading tasks (Usher et al., 2019). In Finland, the use

6

of log files from computer-based assessment enabled
researchers to disentangle the effects of student
motivation when performing reading tasks. Students
who enjoyed reading were found to be more likely to
spend more time on a task and to engage with cognitive
strategies to solve particular reading challenges
(Ronimus et al., 2022). Technology also facilitates universal
design for the assessment of learners with disabilities
or learning difficulties (Almond et al., 2010). In France,
a computer-based reading assessment tool helped group
grade 2 to 9 readers by type of reading difficulty. The tool
distinguished children with hyperlexia and children with
low decoding skills, for which different remediation
strategies are needed (Auphan et al., 2019).
Computer adaptive testing is administered with a
computer or digital device but also uses algorithms
that select test items sequentially to match the level
of the test taker’s proficiency. Computer adaptive
testing uses variable test forms, as opposed to the
fixed forms of traditional pen-and-paper tests (Luecht,
2018; Moncaleano and Russell, 2018). It has been found
to increase measurement precision in China, Cyprus,
Germany, India, Malaysia and Türkiye (Chen, 2023).
In Indonesia, a programme assessing critical thinking in
physics was determined to measure higher-order learning
skills with more precision (Abidin et al., 2019).
Some of the most advanced uses of technology in
learning assessments are observed in fields like medical
and military training where learners are assessed in
virtual simulation environments (Ahir et al., 2019;
Liu et al., 2018; McGrath et al., 2018). The combination
of higher computational power, advances in natural
language processing, improvement in three-dimensional
representations and connected wearable devices makes
it possible to assess learners in virtual scenarios that
would be difficult or impossible in real life (McGrath et al.,
2018). Formative assessments using virtual reality have
been used to train and assess construction workers as
a safe and cost-effective method to prepare them for
hazardous tasks without exposing them to safety risks
(Adami et al., 2021).
To be effectively implemented, technology-based
assessment must strike a good balance between
quality, cost and time. However, quality problems in the
administration of technology-based assessments are not
uncommon (Hillier et al., 2020). For instance, universities
are introducing protocols and policies to deal with
problems such as power, hardware, browser and internet
connectivity failures in online examinations (e.g. University
College London, 2020). As more examinations shifted
online as a result of COVID-19 (Deneen, 2022), the need

for online cheating detection and proctoring tools also
increased. These tools record student computer activity
through webcam video and audio to detect potential fraud
during examinations (Andreou et al., 2021; Harwell, 2022;
Kharbat and Abu Daabes, 2021). While they can reduce
cheating (Milone et al., 2017), their effectiveness should
be weighed against fairness and psychological effects
(Lee and Fanguy, 2022). A high degree of scrutiny and
intrusiveness, and lack of transparency about how they
are being followed, may make students afraid to click too
frequently or even rest their eyes for fear of being signalled
as cheating (Harwell, 2022). As the use of proctored
online assessment tools will continue to increase,
the intersection of artificial intelligence use and ethics will
become an important consideration (Coghlan et al., 2021).
Moreover, while evidence on the quality and usefulness of
technology-based assessments has started to emerge,
much less is known about its cost efficiency. Among the
34 papers on technology-based assessments reviewed for
this report, clear and transparent data on cost were lacking
(Chen, 2023). Cost effectiveness needs to take into account
development, manufacturing, maintenance and operating
costs. It also requires an understanding of the expected
number of learners, the number and type of courses,
adaptations for meeting different learners’ needs, as well
as a usage rate (Chen, 2023; Grunwald, 2009). The little
research available acknowledges potential material-saving
(e.g. paper printing and distribution or administrative costs)
and time-saving features but ignores the costs associated
with the development, operation and waste disposal of
technology-based assessments (Dandan, 2023).
Artificial intelligence opens further opportunities
for reducing costs through automated assessment
development, writing analytics or continuous assessments
through electronic platforms (Swiecki et al., 2022).
Cheating and plagiarism prevention tools have been used
in higher education and research for some time
(Foltỳnek et al., 2019). In Germany, the crowdsourced
plagiarism detection project, VroniPlag, has reviewed
more than 200 dissertations and theses since 2011 in
Austrian, Czech and German universities. In at least 40 of
these, more than two thirds of pages were found to
contain plagiarism (VroniPlag, 2023). However, traditional
plagiarism detection tools that do not use artificial
intelligence have been found to be insufficient. In 2019,
a study of 15 web-based plagiarism detection tools in
8 languages highlighted that they could not detect all
text similarities, especially when students used synonym
replacement, paraphrases or translation. The tools worked
better in some languages than others but also sometimes
identified original materials as false positives
(Foltýnek et al., 2020).

Generative artificial intelligence-based (AI) tools that can
detect texts produced by generative AI, including GPTZero
(Rogers, 2023), DetectGPT (Mitchell et al., 2023), AI Text
Classifier (OpenAI, 2023) and Writer AI Content Detector
(Writer, 2023) have been developed recently.
Overall, advances in digital technology will continue
improving how assessments are designed, administered
and scored. But important issues need to be addressed
to ensure that these approaches remain fair and secure
(International Test Commission and Association of Test
Publishers, 2022).
LEARNING ANALYTICS CAN SUPPORT MANAGEMENT
BUT BRINGS NEW CHALLENGES
The interaction of learners with education hardware
and software generates massive volumes of data that,
when curated and analysed appropriately, can help
teachers understand their students’ progress and
school leaders and system administrators make better
management decisions (Dillenbourg, 2021; Ifenthaler,
2021). Learning analytics can provide formative feedback,
empower students to take decisions pertaining to their
development path, support academic planning, strengthen
early detection systems, and improve curriculum and
assessment alignment (Macfadyen, 2022).
Three approaches of learning analytics have been followed
(Buckingham Shum, 2012). First, at a descriptive level,
schools in richer countries have become familiar with the
dashboards, visualizations and customized reports that
learning management systems have copied from business
intelligence software (Şahin and Ifenthaler, 2021).
Second, at a more advanced level, data on student
characteristics can be combined with their learning
management system use patterns to predict student
trajectories and design supporting interventions
(Ifenthaler, 2021). In Germany, such data have been used
to detect students at risk of failing their studies, looking
at more than 200 individual risk characteristics. Combined
with data on grades, enrolment and study progression,
insights by lecture, course and student cohort support
evidence-based discussions on student management
(Hinkelmann and Jordine, 2019). The use of learning
analytics has been shown to benefit the governance and
the management of institutions (Ifenthaler et al., 2019).
Third, an even more data-intensive approach is based
on computer adaptive software, such as those used for
assessment. Such data help unpack how students learn
concepts, playing an effective formative role. In Viet Nam,
learning analytics and visual data mining obtained with

119

C H A P T E R 6 • E ducation management

a computer adaptive testing tool effectively supported
teachers to monitor the growth of students’ reading skills
in English as a second language and develop teaching
strategies (Aristizábal, 2018). Such data can also help
improve curriculum design. Analytics methods have been
used in digital textbooks, where textbook usage metrics
can be used to predict course grades (Junco and
Clem, 2015).
In classrooms, data from sensors have been used to
analyse interactions and student attention to detect
struggling students (Dillenbourg, 2021). Commercial and
open-source tools have also been used to record student
attendance during online education sessions, albeit at
the cost of raising privacy concerns. For instance, Google
Meet Attendance enables teachers and managers to
record and report on attendance during online sessions
but also to share data with the central level for general
reporting purposes (Smith, 2022). Similar plug-ins exist for
Canvas, Moodle, Teams and Zoom. Recent technological
developments – including the use of AI – have even tracked
students’ attention during online classes. For instance,
facial recognition is being used to record attention levels
during lectures through physical cues such as blink rate,
eye gaze and posture (Rahul et al., 2021)
While learning analytics is becoming part of the education
landscape, few systems can deal with the vast amounts of
data generated. In China, learning analytics has been used
in primary and secondary education to identify learner
difficulties, predict learning trajectories, and manage
teacher resources and professional training. Commercial
applications, such as Homework Gang and Yuanfudao
(Ape Tutor), use optical character recognition and natural
language processing to analyse student test responses,
while Liulishuo uses automatic speech recognition
in oral language evaluations. In Uruguay, Plan Ceibal,
the government agency responsible for the integration
of ICT in education, launched a laboratory in 2022 whose
mission is to improve learning through the combination
of user-centred data analytics and behavioural science
principles (Aguerrebere et al., 2022).
In higher education, learning analytics has been used
more extensively (Lang et al., 2022). In Europe and
Northern America, several universities have developed
early warning systems. Course Signals, a predictive
learning analytics system created in Purdue University,
is used to flag whether a student has a low likelihood to
pass a course in order for educators to target additional
support (Tsai and Martinez-Maldonado, 2022). In Belgium,
the LASSI dashboard helps students regulate their learning
by providing them with data displays that signal how
they compare with their cohort in terms of stress, time
management and examination strategies (Broos et
al., 2020).

6

In Finland, the Digivision 2030 programme aims to
optimize the use of learner data to provide a tailored and
individualized student experience (Digivisio2030, 2023).
The Finnish National Agency for Education has focused
on two projects: KOSKI is an integrated data warehouse
that connects to other major data systems, such as social
insurance and national statistics; and mPassId is the
national unique identification system that allows learners
to access web services such as the student registry and
learning management systems (Aguerrebere et al., 2022).
Despite the opportunities it is creating, learning analytics
also raises important concerns. First, there are ethical
issues. Just because data are available does not mean they

Just because data are available does not mean
they should be used
should be used. It is a highly sensitive process to decide
what data can be analysed, what other data they are to
be combined with, and who can have access to the results
(Slade and Prinsloo, 2013). Second, learning analytics
need to be a valid and reliable representation of student
progress and potential. In practice, they often focuses on
a narrow set of learning outcomes, capturing some but
missing other aspects of student potential, which may
form an unsuitable basis upon which to design support
interventions. Third, the capacity of users to interpret
learning analytics as well as to translate the diagnosis
into appropriate pedagogical interventions tends to be
underestimated (Gašević et al., 2016).
For learning analytics to be effective, challenges that
need to be overcome include improving data
literacy among all system actors (Macfadyen, 2022)
and understanding algorithmic fairness (Kizilcec and Lee,
2022; Loukina et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022). Algorithms
used in decision-making processes are subject to bias
that may render their decisions unfair in many ways. They
may, for instance, single out groups that make sense
algorithmically but not from the perspective of social
policy (Perrotta and Williamson, 2018). Machine learning
algorithms can define high levels of performance in a way
that is disadvantageous for minority groups. Algorithms
can be discriminatory if they learn stereotypical patterns
from observed data and replicate these patterns in
predictions (Wang et al., 2022). While these issues have
been acknowledged in other fields, they remain relatively
neglected in education. It has been argued that perceiving
learners as data constructs by learning analytics can be

misleading and, rather than improving the educational
experience of learners, it may narrow their educational
opportunities (Perrotta and Williamson, 2018).
Another challenge is for learning analytics to be
understood by those concerned (Mandinach and Abrams,
2022). The widespread use of dashboards, charts
and tables to support decision-making requires a
minimum level of data literacy from a broader range
of users, including teachers, students and parents
(Jarke and Breiter, 2019; Lang et al., 2022). Both teacherand student-facing learning analytics applications have
been shown that to be used effectively, they need to
address variation in data literacy skill levels (van Leeuwen
et al., 2022). Low levels of data literacy in European higher
education institutions constitute a critical challenge to
institutionalizing learning analytics (Macfadyen, 2022).
Simplifying complex learning analytics into accessible
data displays, such as traffic light systems, removes
nuances and can distort the meaning behind the data that
educators are meant to interpret in relation to learning
processes (Mandinach and Abrams, 2022).
Multiple data sources, data types, analytical outputs, users
and institutions form a complex set of data and users
that can only yield results if data governance, policies and
processes are in place and supported by new models of
education leadership (Macfadyen, 2022). A survey of senior
managers in Australian universities pointed at leadership
as a critical bottleneck in integrating learning analytics and
other complex technological innovations into management
(Dawson et al., 2018).

LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND CAPACITY
CONSTRAIN TECHNOLOGY USE IN
EDUCATION MANAGEMENT
By one estimate, businesses see only 30% of their digital
transformation projects achieve their objectives. Clear
strategy, leadership commitment, relevant skills, agility,
effective monitoring, and technology resources are
preconditions of success (Forth et al., 2020). If these
factors are difficult to secure in competitive business
environments, it is clear that few education systems
and actors are ready to undergo digital transformation,
despite the presence of good tools to improve education
management (McCarthy et al., 2023). Indeed, technology
infrastructure is often simply not available. As well,
administrators and teachers have beliefs and attitudes
towards technology, which may not facilitate technology
adoption. Finally, education institutions vary in their
capacity to absorb technological change and use it for its
intended purposes.

6

Administrators and teachers are the main users of
education technology for management purposes. It is
through their effective use of applications and devices
that data are generated and used for decision making.
However, a recurrent finding is that education technology
projects have not necessarily addressed the issue of how
technology is managed. Self-efficacy, or confidence in
performing management tasks that require the integration
of technology (Šabić et al., 2022), is strongly associated
with prior successful use. In Kenya and the Philippines,
positive administrator attitudes are a strong predictor of
adoption and use of technology in school management
and, eventually, of school management improvements
(Kirui et al., 2022; Vida Villa and Natividad Eder, 2019).
In Nigeria, a lack of required skills and competencies
explained most of the variability in education management
information system use in universities (Akinwole et al.,
2019). In North Macedonia, increased technological
knowledge and information and communication
technology support were the two factors that directly
influenced usage of education management information
systems (Stamenkov and Zhaku-Hani, 2021).
Technology design plays an important part in driving
attitudes and fostering adoption. Badly designed user
interfaces or frequent bugs which hinder ease of use
compound negative attitudes and the low self-efficacy
of intended users. In Malaysia, the use of an online
education management information system by secondary
school teachers responsible for data entry was positively
influenced by its perceived ease of use (Saad and Daud,
2020). In Jordan, administrative staff perceptions of an
education management information system software’s
ease of use was found to influence its usage within the
education ministry (Alhanatleh, 2020). Perceived ease
of use was also a determinant of staff intention to use
technology in British higher education institutions;
together with perceived usefulness, institutional
support and innovativeness of individuals, it contributes
to explain more than half of the variance in intentions to
use an education management information system
(Zhao et al., 2020).
Whether education institutions are ready to adopt
technology for management depends on their resources
and their ability to integrate technology in daily practices.
The concept of absorptive capacity refers to the ability

121

C H A P T E R 6 • E ducation management

of schools, as learning organizations, to acquire and
apply new knowledge through innovation (Da’as et al.,
2020; Lenart-Gansiniec et al., 2022; Zuckerman et al.,
2018). In settings where technological change is required,
absorptive capacity is an advantage but also a key
source of inequality. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic
highlighted the value of school absorptive capacity for
rapid adjustment to new modes of education delivery.
Combined with effective leadership, absorptive capacity
means that new knowledge can be used and can lead to
school improvement.
However, absorptive capacity varies substantially
between and within countries. Successful education
systems are typically equipped with absorptive capacity
resources, including strong school leaders and confident
teachers willing to innovate (Schleicher, 2015). Rural
schools tend to have fewer financial and human resources
than urban schools, and lag behind in the development
and implementation of technology-related innovation
(Zuckerman et al., 2018). Four conditions determine
school absorptive capacity: prior knowledge; staff skills
acquired from experience and professional development;
engagement with innovative education projects where
teachers and staff have collaborated; and exposure to
external knowledge which provides institutions with more
options to approach problems from different perspectives
(Lenart-Gansiniec et al., 2022). These conditions also
overlap to some extent with the determinants of
technology self-efficacy and attitudes towards
technology integration.
There are few examples of effective institutional
implementation of learning analytics. Many challenges
remain to achieve systemic change (Macfadyen, 2022).
The pace at which learning analytics is making its
way into institutionalized practices is slow, with most
higher education institutions still at the earliest stage:
extraction and reporting of education data (Macfadyen,
2022). Issues remain even in countries where learning
analytics is becoming a priority. In Finland, the Digivision
2030 programme continues to struggle with data sharing,
as many systems still store and maintain their data
separately (Aguerrebere et al., 2022).
Institutional culture is a particularly important factor in the
adoption and use of learning analytics. A survey of senior

6

leaders from 32 universities in Australia showed that
top-down approaches that neglect learners and academic
staff result in poor buy-in (Colvin et al., 2016). Research
covering senior managers from 83 higher education
institutions in 24 European countries found that the
involvement of students as key stakeholders in the design
and implementation of learning analytics is necessary for
learning analytics to be used effectively (Tsai et al., 2020).
Too often, there is a gap between the expected benefits
of technology on education and the realization of these
benefits. This may be because seemingly trivial issues such
as maintenance and repair of infrastructure are ignored
or underestimated (Pangrazio et al., 2022), because there
might be a local reluctance to use big, automated data
(Selwyn, 2020) or because the development and design of
learning analytics has failed to integrate the very objective
of education systems – improving learning – as the core
driver of their development (Lang et al., 2022).

CONCLUSION
Technology offers various opportunities to improve
education system management. It provides the possibility
of expanding the range of data collected on schools
and students and linking them to generate fine-grained
analyses of learning trajectories and the factors that
determine them. Such data can be used to personalize
learning, track marginalized children and prevent
disengagement and early school leaving. Technology
also has the strong potential to support continuous
assessment for learning as well as to expand the range of
skills and outcomes assessed.

Understanding all aspects of a digital
ecosystem is critical for countries that
want to leverage technology to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of their education
system management
However, with that potential comes challenges. Some
question whether the amount of data generated can
be used effectively, not just to monitor but to improve
individual and institutional performance. Policymakers
and school leaders are overwhelmed with the amount of
information and with the range of purported solutions
to combine data, which often do not speak to each other.
The rollout of many technology projects is fraught with
high costs, privacy and security concerns, implementation
challenges and weak capacity. Understanding all aspects
of a digital ecosystem is critical for countries that want
to leverage technology to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of their education system management. Users
need to be put at the centre, improving their attitudes
towards the technology they are expected to adopt,
and strengthening their capacity to use it.

KE Y MESSAGES
Investments to improve access to technology often neglect sustainability.
Access to technology is unequal at home and in schools.


One in four of the world’s primary schools lack electricity; 40% of primary, 50% of lower secondary and 65% of
upper secondary schools are connected to the internet.



Globally, 46% of households had a computer at home in 2020, ranging from 7% in low-income to 80% in highincome countries. The share of schools with computers was 47% among primary, 62% among lower secondary and
76% among upper secondary schools.



Mobile phone ownership is also unequal, reaching 73% of those aged 10 and above worldwide but only 49% in lowincome countries.

Countries use various policies to improve access to technology.


Globally, 85% of countries have legislation or policies in place to improve school or learner connectivity and 52% to
enhance school electrification.



Globally, 30% of countries had policies to provide each student with a laptop or tablet. The share was as high as
61% in Latin America and the Caribbean but has since fallen to 15%.



About one in five countries have policies granting subsidies or deductions for students to buy devices. Such
approaches can reduce schools' financial burden but may widen divides for low-income families. Only 19% of
countries have regulations addressing that risk.

Evidence needs to drive equitable, efficient and sustainable technology solutions.


Several education technology products are underused, if they are used at all. Two studies in the United States
estimated that 67% of education software licences were unused.



A review in the United Kingdom found that only 7% of education technology companies had conducted randomized
controlled trials to evaluate effectiveness.



Investment decisions need to assess whether a technology application has an impact on teaching and learning.
Ghana suspended its One Laptop Per Child programme after three years because sustainability and feasibility
conditions were not fulfilled.

Procurement decisions need to take sustainability into account.


The lifespan and hidden long-term costs of products and services are critical. It has been estimated that initial
investment in education technology represents 25% or less of the eventual total cost.



Devices lead to a surplus of e-waste. Extending the lifespan of all smartphones in the European Union by a year
would be equivalent to taking over 1,000,000 cars off the road in terms of carbon emissions.

Regulation needs to address risk in education technology procurement.


125

Even the most conservative estimate of corruption put it at equivalent to 8% of procurement contracts worldwide
in 2019. In Brazil, the Comptroller General of the Union found irregularities in the electronic bidding process for the
purchase of 1.3 million computers, laptops and notebooks for state and municipal public schools in 2019.

A

ccess to digital technology is now considered a part
of the right to education. The Special Rapporteur
on the right to education recently argued that ‘the
implementation of the right to education must respond
to the needs of all persons to access, master and use
technology as an empowering tool for being active
members of society’ (United Nations Human Rights
Council, 2022). The issue of equitable access has therefore
become key.
Schools, teachers and students need context-appropriate
devices of good quality, relevant software aligned
with national curricula and accessible platforms.
Governments need to pay affordable prices and ensure
proper maintenance of technology. Systems need
to be interoperable and sustainable. Electricity and
telecommunications infrastructure, especially to ensure
internet connectivity, needs to be installed. Yet, many of
these conditions are not met.
The cost of much of that investment is high and beyond the
budget of many countries (Chapter 22). It needs to compete
with other education priorities. Access to technology
ends up being unequally distributed, both between and
within countries. Evidence on the impact of products
and services on learning is limited. Providers are a step
ahead of government officials. Some engage in misleading
marketing practices. Waste and obsolescence are high,
adding to a growing environmental cost of digitalization.
This chapter describes the distribution of technology
resources; efforts to ensure that access to infrastructure,
hardware and software is equitable and affordable; and
initiatives to support evidence-based public procurement
of education technology that leads to equitable, efficient
and sustainable solutions.

ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY IS UNEQUAL
Access to electricity, devices and the internet is highly
unequal between and within countries, including between
schools. In 2021, 770 million people, or almost 9% of the
global population, did not have access to electricity. That
year, access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa exceeded
50% for the first time, although it was still below 30% for
those living in rural areas. In Rwanda, for instance,
18% of rural households have access to electricity, with
12% accessing the grid and 6% off-grid solar devices (World
Bank, 2022). Over a period of two decades, access to
electricity increased by 38 percentage points in Central
and Southern Asia – becoming almost universal – and
by 24 points in sub-Saharan Africa, and 17 points in rural
sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 7.1a). It has been estimated
that universal access to electricity by 2030 will require
USD 413 billion per year (SEforAll, 2020).
The proportion of upper secondary schools with access
to electricity follows the share of the population with
access to electricity. By contrast, the proportion of primary
schools with access to electricity lags behind access in
the general population – by 15 percentage points globally
and 35 percentage points in Central and Southern Asia
(Figure 7.1b). Globally, one in four primary schools does
not have electricity, a prerequisite to benefiting from
technology.

The 2018 Multi-Tier Framework survey found that 60% of
public schools in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Myanmar,
Nepal and Niger had no access to electricity, 31% were
on grid and 9% off grid (IEA et al., 2020). But access
to electricity varies widely between these countries.
The national grid provides energy to 22% of Ethiopian
and 49% of Nepalese schools. In Niger, 5% of schools are
electrified through the grid and 3% through solar energy
sources. Solar power is a backup solution for 15% of Kenyan
and 86% of Cambodian schools. Power interruptions are
costly. On average, only 16% of schools in the six countries
enjoyed uninterrupted supply. Voltage fluctuations damage
devices: 28% of schools experienced equipment damage
because of frequent power surges and outages (IEA et al.,
2020). In South Africa, where a long-standing energy crisis
means many schools cannot operate during load shedding,
the High Court ruled that public schools should be
protected from power cuts (Vollgraaff and Sguazzin, 2023).
Globally, 46% of households had a computer at home in
2020, with the percentage ranging from 7% in low-income
to 80% in high-income countries – and 83% in North
America (Broadband Commission, 2022). But even in
the United States, in 2020, up to 16 million public school

teaching in public schools, lived in households without
adequate digital resources. Closing the digital gap would
have cost between USD 6 billion and USD 11 billion in
2020 and from USD 4 to USD 8 billion per year afterwards
(Ali et al., 2021).
Globally, the shares of schools with computers for
pedagogical purposes was 47% among primary, 62% among
lower secondary and 76% among upper secondary schools
in 2020. But these averages mask considerable inequality.
No primary schools in Chad, and less than 5% in Niger,
Sierra Leone and Togo, had access to computers in 2021.
In Chad and Sierra Leone, less than 10% of secondary
schools had access to computers, according to the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The 2018 Programme
for International Student Assessment (PISA) estimated
that almost each 15-year-old student in a large sample
of middle- and high-income countries had access to a
computer for educational activities in school. But access
ranged from at most 10 computers per 100 students in
Brazil and Morocco to 160 computers per 100 students in
Luxembourg (Figure 7.2) (OECD, 2020).
In European Union member states, 35% of primary, 52% of
lower secondary and 72% of upper secondary schools were

operational equipment; internet speed at school and type
of internet access; and a range of indicators on access to
digital content, including a virtual learning environment
(Deloitte and IPSOS Mori, 2019). Attempts to define a
‘highly equipped and connected classroom’ have since been
updated (European Commission, 2022).

Coverage of mobile telecommunications technology
continues to expand. In 2022, 95% of the global population
was covered by 3G wireless networks and 88% by 4G
technologies such as LTE and WiMAX, although 4G only
reached one third of people in low-income countries
(Figure 7.3a). Mobile phone subscriptions reached 108 per
100 people in 2022; however, they have stagnated at
about 60 per 100 inhabitants in low-income countries
since 2015. Globally, mobile phone ownership reached
73% of those age 10 and above, and 49% in low-income
countries (Figure 7.3b). By 2021, the share of connections
with 3G, 4G or 5G smartphones was higher than with basic
phones, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where basic phone
connections are still the majority (GSMA, 2022b).
Access to the internet is a vital enabler of economic,
social and cultural rights. Universal and meaningful
connectivity can provide the opportunity for users to
have a ‘safe, satisfying, enriching, and productive online
experience at an affordable cost and with a sufficiently
large data allowance’ (ITU, 2022c). In 2016, Article 19 of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was amended
to include a call to all countries to ‘facilitate access to
information on the Internet, which can be an important
tool in facilitating the promotion of the right to education’
(United Nations Human Rights Council, 2016). The drive
for improved connectivity is captured in Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) target 9.c that called on countries
to ‘strive to provide universal and affordable access to
internet in least developed countries by 2020’. One of the
Broadband Advocacy Targets to be achieved by 2025 is
for user penetration to reach 75% worldwide, 65% in lowand middle-income countries, and 35% in least developed
countries (Broadband Commission, 2022).

In 2022, two in three people in the world used the
internet (ITU, 2022b) (Figure 7.4), ranging from only
26% in low-income to 93% in high-income countries.
The share of internet users in urban areas was nearly
twice as high as in rural areas (82% and 46%, respectively)
(ITU, 2023) – and the same gap was nearly three times
wider in Africa (63% vs 23%). High-income countries also
have access problems. The Australian Education Union
estimated that 125,000 public school students lived in
dwellings without internet access. One third of those
living in remote areas faced the same challenge
(Barbara Preston Research, 2020).

There are gender gaps associated with access to
technology. It has been estimated that 9% fewer women
than men own a mobile phone and 16% fewer use mobile
internet in low- and middle-income countries (Broadband
Commission, 2022). The largest gap in mobile ownership
is reported in Pakistan (52 percentage points) but large
gaps are also observed in Benin, Burundi, Mali, Nigeria and
Sierra Leone (MacQuarrie et al., 2022). The largest gender
gaps in internet usage were found in Nepal (20 percentage
points) followed by Pakistan. In some cultures, access and
use of technology are contingent on socio-cultural gender
norms (Myers et al., 2023), where ownership and use
of technology are framed as masculine (Zelezny-Green,
2011), perpetuating unequal access to technology,
including in education (Webb et al., 2020).
Fixed broadband subscriptions, including digital subscriber
line (DSL), satellite, cable and fibre, averaged 18 per
100 people globally, ranging from less than 1 in Africa to
35 in Europe (ITU, 2022a). Mobile broadband gives more
flexibility and is increasingly used to access the internet;
it remains the only option to connect in some contexts,
such as displacement (Culbertson et al., 2019). In late
2021, there were 87 mobile broadband subscriptions
per 100 people, which corresponded to 55% of the global
population accessing mobile broadband, up 20 percentage
points since 2014 (GSMA, 2022b).

Exclusion remains an issue in mobile broadband coverage
and, especially, usage. An estimated 400 million people
are not covered by mobile broadband, while 3.2 billion
do not use mobile internet services, despite being
covered by a mobile broadband network (GSMA, 2022b).
The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), which
represents the interests of the global mobile industry and
mobile operators in particular, has developed a Mobile
Connectivity Index. The Index assesses enablers of mobile
internet adoption (infrastructure, affordability, consumer
readiness, and content and services) in 170 countries.
It ranges from less than 20 in South Sudan and Chad to
more than 90 in Australia, Finland and Singapore
(GSMA, 2022a).
Even if people theoretically have internet access,
the connection may not be affordable or of good quality.
In 44% of low- and middle-income countries with pricing
data, the median cost of 1 gigabyte (GB) of data exceeded
2% of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Large
differences exist between regions: the median cost
was 0.5% of GDP per capita in South Asia and 3.4% in
sub-Saharan Africa (GSMA, 2022b). Globally, those in the
bottom income quintile would need to spend more than
65% of their average monthly income for an entry-level
internet-enabled handset, and the number would
exceed 100% for these users in sub-Saharan Africa

(GSMA, 2021; 2022b). In Brazil, one in four people must
disconnect for at least one week per month; 45% of the
poorest users run out of data on their mobile phone
plan before the end of the month (Telecompaper, 2021).
Access is costlier in remote areas, where digital networks
are more expensive to establish. Even if they existed,
accessing them would cost families two to three times
more than in urban areas (GOLA, 2022).
Internet bandwidth (how much information is received per
second) and speed (how fast that information is received)
are two key measures of connection quality. Applications
necessary for education, such as videoconferencing
and streaming, require high bandwidth. International
bandwidth usage per internet user is estimated to
have increased from 52 to 233 kilobits per second
(kbps) between 2015 and 2022, ranging from 40 kbps
in low-income to 680 kbps in high-income countries,
according to the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) database. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred an
increase in the share of people who had used mobile
internet to support their own, their children’s or their
relatives’ education at least once a week, from 27% in
2019 to 38% in 2021 (GSMA, 2022b).

School connectivity to the internet remains limited.
Globally, 40% of primary, 50% of lower secondary and
65% of upper secondary schools are connected to the
internet, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics.
The ITU has proposed as targets for universal and
meaningful school connectivity a minimum download
speed of 20 megabits per second (mbps) per school
and 50 kbps per student, as well as a minimum data
allowance of 200 GB (ITU and United Nations Office of the
Secretary-General’s Envoy of Technology, 2022).
The Giga project, which mapped 328,000 schools in
49 countries, found that 53% were connected to the
internet (UNICEF and ITU, 2023). In 2020, in Sierra Leone,
less than 1% of primary, 5% of lower secondary and 8% of
upper secondary schools were connected to the internet
(Mullan and Taddese, 2020).

Globally, 40% of primary, 50% of lower
secondary and 65% of upper secondary
schools are connected to the internet
In India in 2020/21, about 50% of urban schools but less
than 20% of rural schools were connected to the internet
(Figure 7.5). The divide was largely determined by the
fact that 53% of private unaided and 44% of private aided
schools, but only 14% of government schools, were
connected (Bhattacharya et al., 2023). The European
Union has set a far more ambitious broadband target,
whereby all schools would have access to 1,000 mbps
internet connection by 2025; yet, in 2019, fewer than 1 in
5 students attended schools with high-speed internet
above 100 mbps (European Commission et al., 2019).

COUNTRIES FOLLOW VARIOUS POLICIES
TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY
Countries use various policies to improve access to
technology. As access to technology will not be equitable
until at least electricity supply and internet connectivity
are universal, many countries concentrate their actions
on strengthening infrastructure: 85% of countries have
legislation or policies for improving school or learner
connectivity. Meanwhile, 38% of countries have a law on
universal internet provision and 27% on universal access to
electricity. About one in five countries has a policy granting
subsidies or deductions to buy devices (Figure 7.6).
Low- and lower-middle-income countries, whose
education systems are impacted more by lack of power,
are more likely to have provisions for universal access
to electricity. While 52% of countries have policies to
enhance school electrification, 83% of sub-Saharan

African countries do. The 2017–2030 Education and
Training Sector Plan of Burkina Faso provides for school
electrification to support the development of evening
classes and non-formal education (Burkina Faso Ministry
of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Innovation
et al., 2017). A policy aims to provide learners with lighting
kits to increase individual learning time. In Kenya, as part
of the 2018 National Electrification Strategy (Kenya
Government, 2018), the Rural Electrification Authority is
leading efforts to provide all primary schools with power
(African Development Bank, 2021). The 2017 National
Electrification Program and Implementation Roadmap
of Ethiopia aims to achieve universal electricity access
by 2025, of which 65% would be on grid and 35% off grid
(Ethiopia Government, 2019). In Rwanda, the ICT and
infrastructure ministries aim to improve school electricity

131

supply through the national grid, generators, and solar and
wind power.

38% of countries have a law on universal
internet provision and 27% on universal access
to electricity

In Bhutan, where all private but only 8% of public schools
had electricity in 2021 (Bhutan Ministry of Education,
2021), the 2020 School Design Guidelines mandate all
schools to have a power supply agreement with the
Electricity Authority (Bhutan Ministry of Education, 2020).

COUNTRIES ARE SHIFTING THEIR POLICIES ON
DEVICES
One-to-one technology models have long been used
to provide each student with one laptop or tablet. Such
approaches are costlier than most interventions and
their effectiveness has been questioned (Hennessy et al.,
2021; GEEAP, 2023). The One Laptop Per Child initiative
is probably the most famous intervention (Chapter 4).
Since its launch in 2005, more than 3 million Linux-based
educational computers at USD 100 each have been
distributed (OLPC, 2023).
Analysis for this report shows that one-to-one technology
programmes were at one time established in 30% of
countries. However, currently only 15% of countries
pursue such programmes. In some cases, this pursuit
has been fuelled by the pandemic. The shift away from
them has been particularly strong in Latin America and
the Caribbean, where 61% of countries had previously

implemented them. By contrast, there has been a small
increase in Europe and Northern America (Figure 7.7).
Argentina reintroduced the Conectar Igualdad programme
in 2022 with the aim of promoting education technology in
public secondary schools and developing strategies for its
integration into teaching and learning processes
(Then24.com, 2022). Devices are distributed according
to criteria such as regular attendance and socioeconomic
status (Argentina Ministry of Education, 2022).
Analysis for this report also suggests that one in five
countries globally, and mainly high-income countries, has a
policy, plan or strategy to provide subsidies, deductions
or cash transfers to parents and/or students to purchase
laptops or tablets. In France, the Digital Education
Territories programme provides basic digital equipment
for 2,700 classrooms and foresees lending equipment
to 15,000 disadvantaged students (France Ministry of
National Education and Youth, 2023).

of sustainability (Jamaica Ministry of Education, Youth
and Information, 2020). The Hong Kong Education Bureau
allows schools to adopt various approaches for the devices
students can bring to school, but notes that many schools
have already made specifications for these devices
(Hong Kong Education Bureau, 2022).

One in five countries globally has a policy, plan
or strategy to provide subsidies, deductions or
cash transfers to purchase laptops or tablets
A number of upper-middle- and high-income countries are
shifting from providing devices to allowing students to use
their own devices in school (Roberts, 2020). In Australia,
a Bring Your Own Device policy replaced the government’s
Digital Education Revolution scheme in 2013 (Australia
Department of Education, 2013). Generally, schools
set their own approach, including establishing codes of
conduct and identifying the groups of learners to exclude
from the use of their own devices at schools, such as those
in primary schools. In South Australia, the Department
of Education stated that each school should have a
policy in place detailing expectations by 2021. Schools
were encouraged to consult with their community to
complete and review their own policies (South Australia
Department of Education, 2021). Jamaica adopted a Bring
Your Own Device policy framework in 2020 for reasons

133

While Bring Your Own Device approaches can reduce the
financial burden for schools and governments, they bring
about other challenges. First, they risk widening divides,
as the students who can access good digital learning
resources are likely to be wealthier. But governments can
try to counter that challenge. In New Zealand, where the
cost of devices varied between USD 200 and USD 1,250,
hardship assistance payments worth USD 3.3 million were
made to almost 25,000 students in the first 3 months
of 2019 (Stock, 2019). Second, teachers may not have
the skills or find it very difficult to organize and manage
learning and teaching activities in a classroom with
different devices and platforms (Ginley, 2021). Moreover,
the management of licences and proprietary rights can be
more complex with personal devices used in schools. Third,
there are privacy and security concerns (Regan and Bailey,
2019). Student-owned devices may not have appropriate
safeguards for storing personal and school data. There
can also be major concerns for theft, cybersafety,
virus protection and the costs of working with multiple
operating systems (Poggi, 2021).
Despite the risks associated with Bring Your Own Device
policies, only 19% of countries have regulations to address
them. Jamaica’s policy set requirements for approved
devices at school along with guidelines for acceptable use.
But without privacy controls, students’ use of educational
platforms from their own devices is open to confidentiality
breaches or worse, cyberattacks (Jamaica Ministry of
Education, Youth and Information, 2020). In Wales,
United Kingdom, the government has issued Bring Your
Own Device guidelines, which refer to health and safety
considerations, such as display screen equipment,
excessive screen time and device accessibility. They also
highlight that attention should be devoted to the impact on
socioeconomic differences and to how schools will manage
and deliver licences for essential applications
(Wales Department of Education, 2019).
SOME COUNTRIES CHAMPION FREE AND OPEN
SERVICE SOFTWARE
In a context where most basic operating systems and
software used in education institutions are proprietary,
some governments support the use of free and open
source software, which can be adapted and improved to
meet specific needs (Nagle, 2022). The content can be

C H A P T E R 7 • A ccess to technology: equity, efficiency and sustainability

7

customized for teaching and learning at a low cost. Such
software includes that used in wikis, GitHub, discussion
forums and member portals, tutorials, textbooks,
professional training and online learning. Open source
software supports education systems by facilitating the
sharing of data and libraries. It is growing: a review of
more than 1,700 code databases found that most of them
contained open source software and that open source
codes in education technology grew by 163% between
2018 and 2022 (Synopsis, 2023).
Education institutions with complex IT infrastructure such
as universities can benefit from open source software
and its flexibility to add new solutions or functionalities.
By contrast, proprietary software does not permit sharing.
Proprietary file formats carry vendor locks that hinder
interoperability, exchange and updates. Awareness about
free and open source software is still low and the required
skills to use it are not widely available. Moreover, there are
costs to deploy and maintain it.
Yet some countries are turning to open sources for public
services, including education. X-Road is the open source
data exchange used as the backbone of government
e-services in Estonia, including for the collection and
management of education information (Nordic Institute
for Interoperability Solutions, 2023a). It has been exported
and is being implemented in Faroe Islands, Finland,
Iceland, Japan, Kyrgyzstan and Mexico (Nordic Institute
for Interoperability Solutions, 2023b). Similar technology
based on the Estonian interoperability experience has
also been implemented in Namibia and Ukraine
(e-Governance Academy Foundation, 2017). In
North Macedonia, while education moved to Zoom and
Google during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government
searched for a sustainable solution. Along with university
and other partners, the Ministry of Education and
Science set up a platform combining Moodle, a free and
open-source tool, with Microsoft Teams, to enable video
classes and communication, connecting 27,000 students
across the country and supporting them to continue
learning online at zero cost (Mrmov, 2020).
In India, the National e-Governance Plan, launched in 2015,
makes it mandatory for all software applications and
services used in government to be built on open source
software to achieve efficiency, transparency, reliability
and affordability. The government of India is accordingly
encouraging the use of GNU/Linux (Thankachan and
Moore, 2017). The National Resource Centre for Free and
Open Source Software supports development, awareness
and adoption, notably through the free Bharat Operating
System Solutions certified by Linux and supported
in 18 Indian languages (India Ministry of Electronics

and Information Technology, 2021). Its educational
variant, EduBOSS, is a free operating system for schools
(CDAC, 2023). The Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge
Sharing, or DIKSHA, is a portal and mobile application
launched in 2017 as a repository for e-books, e-content
and assessments published by states and national
organizations for grades 1 to 12 (India Government, 2021).
The free software policy in the state of Kerala, for instance,
means that more than 2 million computers used in schools
carry the latest version of free and open source software
(Financial Express, 2019).
COUNTRIES ARE COMMITTED TO UNIVERSAL
INTERNET PROVISION AT HOME AND IN SCHOOL
Commitments to universal internet provision are a
foundation for equitable access. But while 155 countries
emphasize broadband in their national digital plans or
strategies (Broadband Commission, 2022), analysis
of the Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER)
country profiles suggests that only 78 countries have
universal service provision for connectivity. In Benin,
the 2016–2019 National Programme for Universal
Electronic Communication and Postal Services targeted
populations that were poorly served due to location,
inability to pay or inability to use ICT. The Benin Digital
Code (2018) highlights the non-discriminatory, fair and
transparent nature of affordable universal service.
Public infrastructure, including community digital points,
offer Wi-Fi at no cost in youth centres and municipal
libraries. These measures have helped Benin’s internet
penetration (34%) to catch up with the regional average
(36%), although other western African countries, such as
Ghana (68%), Mauritania (59%) and Senegal (58%), and other
sub-Saharan African countries, such as Botswana (74%)
and Cabo Verde (70%), have done much better.
Measures targeting school connectivity are essential.
One estimate suggests that a 10% increase in school
connectivity could contribute to increases of 1.1% to GDP
per capita and 0.6% to effective years of schooling (The
Economist Intelligence Unit, 2021). An analysis of the PEER
country profiles shows that 77% of low-income countries
address school connectivity in plans and policies.
The Bangladesh 2020–25 Eighth Five-Year Plan aims
to connect all secondary schools to electricity and the
internet by 2025. The Digital India programme includes the
Technology for Education – e-Education Plan, which aims
to connect all schools to broadband and provide free Wi-Fi
to all 250,000 secondary and higher secondary schools.
In Nepal, within the 2019 Digital Nepal framework, a Rural
Telecommunication Fund aims to enhance community
school connectivity in hard-to-reach areas.

In Brazil, the Connected Innovation Education Policy
established by law in 2021 supports the universalization of
high-speed internet access to promote the pedagogical use
of digital technology in basic education (Brazil Presidency
of the Republic, 2021). In Oman, the government has
connected 141 rural schools to high-speed internet via
satellite, as part of efforts to achieve universal school
connectivity (Oman Daily Observer, 2020). In Uganda,
the 2021 Digital Education Standards and Guidelines aim
to provide minimum internet bandwidth connectivity of
512 kilobits per student in all schools (Uganda Ministry
of Education and Sports, 2021). The multicountry Giga
initiative has been working in partnership with ministries
of education and other stakeholders to expand school
connectivity (Box 7.1).
Governments and providers lower internet connection costs
in various ways
The Affordability Drivers Index is a composite score
calculated by the Alliance for Affordable Internet, which
assesses the extent to which the policy, regulatory and
supply-side environment helps lower cost and improve
broadband affordability. It suggests that progress in
72 low- and middle-income countries has been slow: in
2021, 53 countries had a national broadband plan but
investment per user varied widely between countries
and remained low in many (Alliance for Affordable
Internet, 2021; Giga et al., 2023). Governments can affect
affordability through direct public investment
(Roddis et al., 2021a) but also with taxes, subsidies and
loans for families, and through licensing and authorization
frameworks for providers (World Bank, 2014). Another
channel that governments can use to increase affordability
is universal service funds (Box 7.2).
Taxes on digital services can help regulate the sector but
can also increase the cost for end users and negatively
affect affordability. For instance, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the introduction of a Central
Equipment Identity Register tax, i.e. a yearly payment of
USD 7 for 3G and 4G handsets, increased the cost of 1 GB
of data by almost 10% (GSMA, 2021). By contrast, removing
a 4.2% excise duty on mobile services in Argentina could
increase the number of unique subscribers by 2.1%
(Working Group Report on Smartphone Access et al., 2022).
Grants, subsidies and loans to poor families and
schools are another way to reduce connectivity costs.
In Costa Rica, the Hogares Conectados (Connected
Households) programme provides access to subsidized
devices and a subsidy to the poorest 60% of households
with school-age children to cover part of the internet
cost, helping reduce the share of unconnected

The Giga initiative supports school connectivity
leveraging multiple stakeholders
The UNICEF Office of Innovation and the International
Telecommunication Union launched the Giga initiative in
2019 with the ambitious aim to connect every school to the
internet by 2030. The initiative has been referenced in the UN
Secretary-General’s Digital Cooperation Roadmap and Our
Common Agenda (United Nations, 2020; 2021). Giga works in
partnership with governments to map connectivity demands;
plan interventions to connect schools; and provide countries
with safe, secure, reliable, fit-for-purpose infrastructure to
support digital development needs (Giga et al., 2023). Across
Latin America and the Caribbean, over 540,000 schools
were mapped and over 1,000 connected (Giga et al., 2022).
In Colombia, artificial intelligence was used to map schools
from satellite imagery (UNICEF Office for Innovation, 2021).
In Kazakhstan, Giga is supporting the government to bridge
the urban–rural school digital divide (ITU and UNICEF, 2020).
The digital development ministry aims to make the public
education system ‘digital by default’, improving broadband
connectivity, strengthening digital skills and making the online
environment safer (ITU and UNICEF, 2023a). In Kyrgyzstan,
school mapping allowed the government to renegotiate
contracts to generate savings totalling 40% of its education
connectivity budget. Prices were cut nearly by half and speed
was almost doubled, from 2 to 4 mbps. Nearly all public
schools are currently connected to the internet (ITU and
UNICEF, 2023a; UNICEF Office for Innovation, 2021).
In Kenya, Giga connected 110 schools, and plans to connect
1,050 more, out of a total of 23,000 schools (Giga et al.,
2022). In Niger, where just 80 of more than 19,000 schools
are currently connected, Giga and the government are using
mapping, monitoring technologies and innovative financing to
implement cost-effective connectivity. In Rwanda, investment
by Giga mobilized private funds to reach remote schools with
high-speed internet. The connectivity demand of 63 schools
in the Eastern Province was aggregated and a common bid
helped reduce the average price schools paid by between
30% and 55%. Fixed wireless boosted connectivity speed for
schools by 400% (UNICEF Office for Innovation, 2021).

households from 41% in 2016 to 13% in 2019 (Foditsch
and Alliance for Affordable Internet, 2023). In 2021,
the government of Nepal introduced free internet access
to all community schools, aiming to equip 60% of them
with free broadband by the end of 2022 (Regmi, 2021).
In South Africa, the Telecommunications Act provides at

Universal service funds could help equitable
access but few succeed
Universal service funds aim to address gaps between
governments’ goals to provide universal ICT service on the one
hand, and access, price and quality of ICT services and products
on the other (Trucano, 2015). They can be used to fund
infrastructure deployment, public access to ICT, content and
government digital capabilities (Alliance for Affordable Internet
and Internet Society, 2021; UN ESCAP, 2017). However, high
levels of undisbursed funds; the rigid and inappropriate legal
frameworks within which they operate; lack of reporting,
transparency and institutional capacity; and frequent lack
of a gender-specific focus have raised concerns on their use
and effectiveness (Bleeker, 2019; Thakur and Potter, 2018),
including in Asia and the Pacific and in some Caribbean
countries (Roddis et al., 2021b; UN ESCAP, 2020).
In 2018, universal funds existed in 37 African countries and
were active in 23, which had disbursed funds in the previous
2 years. Unspent funds were estimated at some
USD 180 million. The disbursement rate ranged between
47% in 2012 and 54% in 2016 (Thakur and Potter, 2018).
Among 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries, 18 had
active and 4 had inactive funds, while only Haiti and Uruguay
didn't have any (Alliance for Affordable Internet and Internet
Society, 2021). Brazil had a dormant fund, but a 2021 law
allocated over USD 650 million to guarantee connectivity
for public school students and teachers, partially funded
by the universal access fund (Brazil Presidency, 2021). The
primary targets are students belonging to families enrolled
in the Single Registry for Social Programmes of the Federal
Government (CadÚnico) and those enrolled in schools
of indigenous and quilombola communities (Alliance for
Affordable Internet, 2023; Brazil Presidency, 2021).
A review of 72 low- and middle-income countries found
that 29 countries performed well in terms of using funds to
prioritize investments to reduce costs and enhance access for
underserved groups (A4AI, 2022). In Pakistan, which ranked
first, the first set of interventions financed by the universal
service fund were used to boost ICT for girls, providing devices
and trained teachers to 226 schools in Islamabad serving
110,000 students (Pakistan Universal Service Fund, 2022).
Thailand, Türkiye, Vanuatu and Viet Nam have also used their
respective universal service and access funds to provide
internet access to education institutions and establish internet
access centres for underserved populations and areas (UN
ESCAP, 2017).

least a 50% discount for internet services to education
institutions (South Africa Republic, 2016). In Singapore,
the DigitalAccess@Home programme subsidizes
broadband, as well as laptops or tablets, for poor families
(Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority, 2023).
In the United States, the Affordable Connectivity Program,
launched in 2022, targets households with income below
200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or who receive
free or reduced-price school meals, offering a discount for
internet services (United States Federal Communication
Commission, 2022; United States Universal Service
Administrative Company, 2022).
Zero-rating is the practice of providing free internet
access under certain conditions. For instance, some
mobile network operators offer not charging for data
used for educational purposes (Bayat et al., 2022;
Eisenach, 2015), a practice which received attention during
the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such practices are
challenging in terms of competition because they violate
the net neutrality principle, which states that internet
service providers should treat all internet traffic equally,
not necessarily in processing data but indirectly in pricing
such traffic (European Commission, 2017). In the European
Union, zero-rating is neither allowed nor forbidden. In the
United States, rules do not ban zero-rating practices
(Olukotun, 2015; Rodríguez Prieto, 2017; Vogelsang, 2019).
The concern has been that poor users come to equate the
internet with zero-rated content provided by companies,
such as Facebook, and do not get to benefit from the
rest of the internet content, which comes at a cost
(Leidel, 2015).
In 2020, the zero-rating portal Colombia Aprende
(Colombia Learns) was introduced to support learning
continuity during the pandemic (Colombia Presidency,
2020). The portal was optimized for mobile devices
through the Colombia Aprende Móvil application.
An agreement between the government and mobile
operators opened up opportunities for free teaching and
learning to students, teachers and school administrators,
accessible from their mobile phones. Yet challenges
emerged during implementation. It was difficult to ensure
equal and equitable access to online resources, as the
existing infrastructure could not support the new mode
of mobile learning and facilitate access to the ministry’s
online portal which hosted the educational resources.
There were also difficulties in cataloguing and curating
digital content (Razquin et al., 2023). Still, the online portal
received nearly 283,000 visits by about 66,000 users in
the first 4 weeks (Sanchez Ciarrusta, 2020).

EVIDENCE NEEDS TO DRIVE EQUITABLE,
EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
Achieving universal provision of electricity, internet,
and hardware and software for schools, teachers and
students involves substantial amounts of money and
requires good investment decisions supported by effective
procurement processes. Evidence is critical to determine
good investments (Hennessy et al., 2021), especially when
the resources and infrastructure to support technology are
limited. Value for money should be a key decision criterion,
as several education technology products are underused,
if they are used at all. The quality and reliability of vendors
also needs to be assessed alongside the relevance of
the solution.

Value for money should be a key decision
criterion, as several education technology
products are underused, if they are used at all
Most evidence on these issues comes from the
United States. Two studies by data analytics providers
estimated that an average of 67% of education software
licences were unused (Davis, 2019) and 98% were not
used intensively (Baker and Gowda, 2018). Another study
based on the EdTech Genome Project, coordinated by
the Jefferson Education Exchange, estimated that 85% of
some 7,000 pedagogical tools on which USD 13 billion
had been spent were ‘either a poor fit or implemented
incorrectly’ (Foresman, 2019). The National Edtech
Equity Dashboard, which assesses student and teacher
engagement with 11,000 education technology products,
has shown that disadvantaged students’ engagement is
worse (LearnPlatform, 2022). Less than one in five of the
top 100 education technology tools used in classrooms
met the requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act
(ESSA); only 39% had published research and 26% had
research aligned with the Act (LearnPlatform, 2023).
RIGOROUS EVIDENCE IS RARELY USED TO MAKE
DECISIONS ON TECHNOLOGY
Evidence is needed for making decisions on technology in
education. Teachers, schools and administrators need to
know the product features best suited to their education
priorities. Technology may not even be the best or only
solution to consider: people are often attracted by new
education technology (UNESCO, 2022a), and purchasing for
the sake of technology rather than for pedagogical reasons
is a common mistake.

137

Research cannot keep up with the speed at which new
education technologies emerge (Burns, 2022). Rigorous
evaluation is often missing even for high-profile
programmes (Hennessy et al., 2021), and national
policies and programmes are rarely informed by
evidence (Jameson, 2019; Slavin, 2020). A review in the
United Kingdom by EdTech Impact, a company that collects
independent, verified reviews of education technology
products to help improve trust with prospective teacher
and school customers, found that 7% of education
technology companies had conducted randomized
controlled trials, 12% had used third-party certification and
18% had engaged in academic studies (Sandhu, 2021). This
is not to suggest that only these types of evidence should
be used. Rather, an evidence portfolio can help answer
different questions (Kucirkova, 2023) and account for
diverse real-world settings (Joyce and Cartwright, 2020).
However, accessing impartial advice can be challenging.
At least two different assessments are needed. First,
a technology needs to prove it has an impact on
teaching and learning. When evidence of effectiveness
is unavailable, decisions tend to rely on referrals and
anecdotal knowledge (Morrison et al., 2019). A 2021 survey
of 1,500 teachers and administrators by a portal software
company in the United States found that about half
of teachers identified new digital tools through other
teachers in their district (Clever, 2022). Another online
survey of teachers and administrators in 17 states showed
that only 11% requested peer-reviewed evidence prior to
technology adoption (United States Office of Education
Technology, 2018). Recommendations from others
in-person or electronically influence purchase decisions
on education technology products. Yet reviews from
education technology suppliers tend to omit issues such
as security and quality standards. Moreover, ratings can
be manipulated based on fake reviews and disseminated
through the social media (He et al., 2022).
Second, evidence is needed on the implementation of
education technologies that may have proven their
potential in principle. In Rwanda, as part of the One Laptop
Per Child programme, computers were reportedly stolen
or, when damaged, left unrepaired (IGIHE, 2020). Even
when thefts and damages were reported, the issues were
not resolved. The Auditor General considered that the
programme did not attain the intended objective, and the
investment was a loss of public resources with no value
for money (Rwanda Office of the Auditor General, 2021).
Ghana suspended its programme after three years of
implementation because basic sustainability and feasibility
conditions, such as power supply, laptop durability,
and costs of connectivity and maintenance, were not
fulfilled (Steeves and Kwami, 2017).

7

Various responses have been organized to systematize
the collection of information on technology effectiveness.
In the United States, both government and academic
efforts try to fill the evidence gap. The United States
Department of Education established the What Works
Clearinghouse in 2002 to provide a trusted source of
evidence on education interventions, including those
related to technology. Its team contracts private research
entities to review research and summarizes the findings,
including whether studies meet quality standards
(United States Institute of Education Sciences, 2023).
However, its reporting quality has been questioned
in academic circles (Reeves and Lin, 2020) and in
media reports. An incisive summary of the evidence
contained in the Clearinghouse pointed out that
only 188 of 10,654 studies showed that products had
‘strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness’
(Garcia Mathewson and Butrymowicz, 2020).
The government of the United States has described three
levels of evidence – strong, moderate and promising – to
differentiate products that can be funded under ESSA.
However, the demand has grown for independent reviews.
Universities have championed alternative efforts to
produce and summarize evidence. The Center for Research
and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University
launched Evidence for ESSA in 2016 to help schools decide
how to invest federal resources for which they are eligible
(Evidence for ESSA, 2023). The EdTech Evidence Exchange,
originally based out of the University of Virginia, developed
a platform where registered teachers can access evidence
on technology interventions ranked on the basis of Edtech
Genome Project measurement instruments (EdTech
Evidence Exchange, 2021). Ten factors are proposed to
make purchase decisions, which span from teacher beliefs
to professional development and implementation (EdTech
Evidence Exchange, 2023). A related initiative, Edtech
Tulna, was established in India in 2020 (Box 7.3).
Multiple actors can help make better informed choices
on procuring education technology. The European
Commission has funded a team of experts from schools,
education ministries and research institutes to develop
Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering the use
of Innovative Educational technologies (SELFIE), a free tool
to help schools embed digital technologies into teaching,
learning and assessment. Each school that completes
SELFIE receives a report containing data and insights on
the weaknesses and strengths of the technology applied
(European Commission, 2023).
The International Society for Technology in Education
(ISTE), a non-profit organization, is involved in issues
ranging from digital citizenship to artificial intelligence and

computational thinking (ISTE, 2023b). It issued standards
for effective use of technology in schools (ISTE, 2023a),
identifying five pillars of selection (privacy, alignment
with standards, research and evidence, implementation,
and the role of teachers) and publishing a practical guide
for educators (ISTE and Project Unicorn, 2023). Arguably,
some of these initiatives have close links with the
education technology industry, which may ultimately be
serving market expansion objectives.
International partnerships have also funded resources
to support decision making. The United Kingdom Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, the World Bank, and the Bill
& Melinda Gates Foundation (which has funded several
of the initiatives identified earlier in the United States)
have helped establish the EdTech Hub, a partnership that
supports low- and middle-income countries to make
informed decisions about technology in education through
research (EdTech Hub, 2022). In Malawi, for instance,
it tested different approaches for personalized learning
tablets for both classroom and home use. In the
United Republic of Tanzania, it supports the design of a
technology-enabled, school-based teacher professional
development programme (EdTech Hub, 2022). A rapid
response service provides evidence-based advice on
demand to inform how education technology is used
in education policies and programmes; to date, it has
been used by 54 countries (R4D, 2022). Meanwhile,
the World Bank has developed 16 knowledge packs,
covering teacher development related to learner-centred
technology, to explain the context in which it is relevant
to use education technologies and insights for successful
implementation (Barron et al., 2022).
PROCUREMENT DECISIONS NEED TO TAKE
SUSTAINABILITY INTO ACCOUNT
One of the most important issues in education technology
procurement decisions is sustainability. These decisions
have economic, social and environmental impacts that
need to be considered (Selwyn, 2021; 2023).
With respect to economic considerations, the lifespan of
products and service is critical. The so-called total cost of
ownership should incorporate both the initial investment
and the operational and support cost for the entire lifespan
(Chuang et al., 2021; Morrison et al., 2019). As well as the
initial cost, there are other recurrent and hidden costs,
such as compatibility and interoperability with the existing
information technology environment, depreciation,
replacement needs, and even training (Mitchell and
D’Rozario, 2022; UNCTAD, 2012). Buying devices for
schools implies additional electricity needs, replacement
of equipment when it is broken or outdated, purchases of

B OX 7.3:

In India, a public–private partnership tries to
promote better evidence on education technology
India has been a global champion of information technology for
a very long time, but it has recently witnessed the expansion
of an unregulated education technology market, which
has grown in response to strong household aspirations for
education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
households make choices on education applications without
research evidence on their learning impact. Moreover, the
business models employed by education technology firms
offering free content options can be misleading. Byju’s, the
leading education technology company in the country, has
received criticism for its aggressive sales strategy, where
parents are contacted to convert to paid subscriptions after a
trial period (UNESCO, 2022). The government was prompted
to alert the public to be on guard when signing up for free
online content or services (India Ministry of Education, 2021).
But companies such as Byju’s have also been working with
state governments. Its not-for-profit arm made an agreement
with the government of Andhra Pradesh to provide free digital
content to almost half a million grade 8 students
(The Economic Times, 2022).
A systematic evaluation framework of the product quality
of education technology is therefore needed. EdTech Tulna
(EdTech Comparison) is a partnership between Central Square
Foundation, a private think tank, and a public university, the
Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai. EdTech Tulna offers
three resources: domain-specific quality standards, which
outline the features of an effective education technology
product to contribute towards a shared understanding of
quality; an evaluation toolkit consisting of reviewer guidelines
and scoring sheets; and publicly available expert reviews
of various products (EdTech Tulna, 2023). Each product is
assessed in terms of its content quality, its alignment with
the national educational requirements and its integration of
appropriate pedagogy. For each dimension, the product is rated
on a three-point scale.
Two states in India have already adopted the EdTech Tulna
framework for software procurement and its toolkits in
evaluation products for tender processes. The government of
Haryana has used the resources when procuring personalized
adaptive learning solutions in upper secondary education. The
EdTech Tulna evaluation framework was adjusted to create
Haryana Tulna to respond to the specific context and needs.
The government of Madhya Pradesh also used the standards
to procure personalized adaptive learning solutions for some
1,000 schools (Anand and Dhanani, 2021).

cables and printers, security, user training and support,
and maintenance. Manufacturers tend to base warranties
for devices on an average of a three- to five-year lifespan.
But this lifespan is likely to be shorter for educational
institutions, as products are exposed to more intensive
use. Shorter lifespan, tighter budgets and the ongoing
semiconductor shortage which has impacted supply chains
are increasing the risk of education technology disruption.

Initial investment in education technology
has been estimated at up to only 25% of the
total cost
Initial investment in education technology has been
estimated at up to only 25% of the total cost (UNESCO,
2022b). A computer-assisted learning programme in
China installed computers in all rural primary schools.
While computers were donated for free, the programme
cost was USD 7.60 per student for intensive teacher
training, maintenance costs, compensation for teacher
instructors and depreciation of laptop computers (Lai et al.,
2016; Mo et al., 2015; Rodriguez-Segura, 2020). Ghana
implemented a pilot programme to reach rural primary
schools by satellite. Fixed costs accounted for 43% of the
total programme cost, while the remaining 57% was used
for maintenance, teacher and facilitator salaries, and other
administrative costs (Johnston and Ksoll, 2017). India’s One
Laptop Per Child programme cost USD 229 per computer
but the overall implementation cost was USD 461,
including maintenance (10% per year), training, servers and
back-office support (Bando et al., 2016).
Another potential hidden cost with both economic and
broader consequences is privacy. In 2022, the Special
Rapporteur on the right to education called for
procurement regulations to ensure due diligence for
protecting children’s privacy and personal data in relation
to online learning, as well as to guide education institutions
to put data privacy clauses in contracts signed with
private providers (United Nations Human Rights Council,
2022) (Chapter 8). In the United States, some states
require companies to sign agreements with schools
and universities to protect student data, while others
have established data privacy regulations with which
companies must comply. In the state of California, vendors
are required to sign a Standard Student Data Privacy
Agreement, which provides comprehensive protection
(Education Technology Joint Powers Authority, 2023).

C H A P T E R 7 • A ccess to technology: equity, efficiency and sustainability

7

The biggest economic concern related to sustainability
is how giant technology firms, despite significant efforts
to regulate their activities, use their dominant position
to enter education and further strengthen their near
monopoly on the market. Google Workspace for Education
and Google Classroom, which play the role of a learning
management system, are being used to extract student
personal data for advertising purposes (Krutka et al., 2021).
Amazon Web Services is increasingly influencing education
through cloud computing, data storage and platform
technology services, taking advantage of the increasing
use of data in system management. It hosts several
education technology providers, helping them scale up
their platforms on its cloud, offering data centre, network,
security, content delivery and machine learning services
(Williamson et al., 2022).
With respect to social considerations, procurement
processes need to address equity, accessibility, local
ownership and appropriation. Accessibility should be
addressed from the start (Federico et al., 2020).
Assistive technology can be expensive, particularly in
low resource contexts (Alasuutari et al., 2022; UNICEF
and WHO, 2022). The Global Initiative for Inclusive ICT
has developed a roadmap to help education systems
integrate accessibility in their policies and procurement
practices (Global Initiative for Inclusive Education, 2021;
2022). In the United States, the Voluntary Product
Accessibility Template explains the extent to which ICT
products conform to IT accessibility standards and helps
public officials to procure those products (United States
General Services Administration, 2022). Accessibility
can be assessed using the Perceivable, Operable,
Understandable and Robust model, which is the
foundation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(CAST, 2023; W3C WAI, 2023).
Local ownership and appropriation are key for sustainable
investments in technology (Fundacion Telefonica and
Fundacion La Caixa, 2022). In France, the first edition of
the Territoires Numériques Educatifs (Digital Educational
Territories) initiative was criticized because some of the
subsidized equipment did not respond to local needs (Foin,
2021), while regional and local governments were left out
of the decisions of which equipment to purchase (Rabiller,
2018). Following the evaluation of the first stage of the
programme, local authorities are now invited to participate
in the design and financing of the intervention. Regional
councils may be required to consult municipalities on their
needs (Lesay, 2021).
In the bidding process, local firms, especially small and
medium-sized enterprises, can be at a competitive
disadvantage to the international firms dominating the

market. In Chile, the 15% decrease in the budget of the
Becas TIC programme, part of the Seamos Comunidad
(Let’s Be a Community) plan launched in 2022 was
primarily due to fluctuations in the exchange rate and price
increases (Chile Ministry of Education, 2022). The reliance
on imported, instead of locally produced, devices highlights
the need for better planning and management to ensure
all students’ needs are met (Foditsch and Alliance for
Affordable Internet, 2023).
There are various dimensions with respect to
environmental considerations. Water, energy and natural
materials consumed to create education technology
contributes considerably to environmental damage and
the climate crisis. Distributing devices to each student
rather than having students share a device leads to a
surplus of e-waste when outdated products are discarded
(Selwyn, 2021; 2023). This issue is particularly pertinent in
low-income contexts that lack infrastructure to properly
manage waste and have lower rates of formal
e-waste collection.
It has been estimated that the reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions achieved by extending the lifespan of all laptops
and smartphones in the European Union by a year would
be the equivalent of taking 870,000 cars and over 1 million
cars off the road, respectively (European Environmental
Bureau, 2019). A movement calling for improvements in
the repairability and reliability of tablets and phones has
emerged. In the United States, the Right to Repair Act was
signed in December 2022 but will only apply to products
made after 1 July 2023 and excludes from its reach any
‘product sold under a specific business-to-government or
business-to-business contract … not otherwise offered for
sale directly by a retail seller’ (Ganapini, 2023). The right to
repair does not yet exist in the European Union (Ganapini,
2022), although a draft EU regulation published in late
2022 sets some obligations for manufacturers (Vallauri,
2022).
A submission to the Advisory Committee of the Human
Rights Council emphasized that ‘the drive toward
universal internet connectivity is rarely considered in
relation to energy usage and climate change … [even
though] reliable and sustainable energy is a precondition
for internet access’ especially for the unconnected,
often ‘predominantly rural, located in the Global South,
and economically disadvantaged’ (Allmann and Hazas,
2019). Yet energy-efficient solutions for education
technology are not widespread. Schools represent a large
share of the public building stock (Lara et al., 2015). Already
10 years ago in the United States, computing consumed
18% of electricity usage in schools and 19% in colleges and
universities (Friendly Power, 2020b; 2020a).

REGULATION NEEDS TO ADDRESS RISKS IN
EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT
Public procurement is vulnerable to collusion
(Baranek et al., 2021; Kawai and Nakabayashi, 2022)
and corruption (Decarolis and Giorgiantonio, 2022a;
Titl et al., 2021; Titl and Geys, 2019). In the European
Union, one estimate suggested 10 years ago that losses
from corrupt or questionable procurement cases added
up to 18% of budgets (PwC and Ecorys, 2013). Globally,
even the most conservative estimate raises the cost of
corruption to 8% of the value of procurement contracts,
or approximately USD 880 billion in 2019 (Bosio, 2021).
Education technology procurement is not immune to
these risks. In Brazil, the Comptroller General of the Union
found irregularities in the electronic bidding process
for the purchase of 1.3 million computers, laptops and
notebooks for state and municipal public schools in
2019 (Flores, 2019). Indeed, the report showed that some
schools received two or three laptops per student (Valor
Economico, 2022). In 2021, the legal dispute over the
rules of the bidding process for the largest purchase of
computers in Costa Rica’s history (Foditsch and Alliance
for Affordable Internet, 2023) was adjudicated by the
Comptroller General: while the competitive process was
not cancelled, the conditions under which the procurement
was made were required to be reassessed
(El Financiero, 2021).
Decentralizing public procurement to local governments
is one proposal to balance some of those risks. Some
countries have used technology to support procurement
processes at the school level, such as Indonesia with
its SIPLah e-commerce platform (Indonesia Ministry of
Communication and Informatics Office, 2023). However,
this has been found to add other risks related to weak
governance mechanisms and organizational capacity.
A review of 30 European countries’ procurement between
1996 and 2015 found that the decentralization of
procurement did not promote good governance, even if
decentralization of services such as education had been
beneficial overall (Kyriacou and Roca-Sagalés, 2020).
A survey of administrators in 54 school districts in the
United States found that they had rarely carried out needs
assessments (Morrison et al., 2019).
Procurement laws, rules and regulations are needed.
The Agreement on Government Procurement requires that
domestic public procurement procedures be based

141

on principles of transparency, non-discrimination and
procedural fairness (World Trade Organization, 2023).
The European Commission issued specific guidelines for
procuring information technology in 2015, highlighting
interoperability, sharing and reuse strategies, and open
ICT systems to avoid vendor lock-in effects (Bargiotti and
Dewyngaert, 2015). In Ireland, the government published
procurement guidance and a toolkit for schools (Ireland
Department of Education and Skills, 2016). Uganda
has published guidelines on procurement, providing
information on eligible ICT expenditure at district and
school level (Uganda Ministry of Education and
Sports, 2021).

Less than one third of countries have a
sustainability clause in their procurement law
Sustainability clauses are emerging, albeit slowly. Analysis
of the World Bank Global Public Procurement Database for
this report found that less than one third of countries have
a sustainability clause in their procurement law. Countries
show more interest in domestic preference clauses (46%)
and small and medium-sized enterprises clauses (just over
50%). Crown Commercial Service, a procurement agency
in the United Kingdom, launched an ICT procurement
contract designed with the Department of Education to
increase the participation of small and medium-sized
enterprises (which made up more than three quarters
of suppliers) (Mari, 2019) and simplify the process of
purchasing technology products and services for education
organizations (Rogers, 2019). In Türkiye, as part of the
Fatih project on information technology in education,
the government requires that equipment from winning
bidders be made at least partly in the country
(Razquin et al., 2023).
Civil society organizations have set up mechanisms to
monitor public spending to increase the transparency and
accountability of public procurement. Poder Ciudadano
(Citizen Power) in Argentina and Fundación Ciudadanía
y Desarrollo (Citizenship and Development Foundation)
in Ecuador introduced procurement observatories that
reviewed emergency public procurement contracts during
COVID-19, among which education technology figured
prominently (FCD, 2023; Poder Ciudadano, 2023).

C H A P T E R 7 • A ccess to technology: equity, efficiency and sustainability

CONCLUSION
Access to and use of education technology is characterized
by inequality, a phenomenon that received greater
attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The costs
of electricity, internet connection, and hardware and
software are high and often underestimated. Sustainability
concerns go beyond social dimensions and extend to
economic and environmental aspects. As technology
is constantly changing, making decisions that promote
equity and quality requires expert guidance from trusted
sources. However, the very sources of such expertise
inherently have financial interests, which could be seen to
compromise their independence. Regulatory enforcement
of equitable policies and practices can be difficult to
implement if governments are unable to invest sufficiently
in the technical expertise which it requires.
Sound, rigorous and impartial evidence is needed more
than ever. Procurement regulations and standards
need to embed sustainability as a criterion for adopting
interventions that are economically, socially and
environmentally effective and efficient and can be scaled
up for the good of all.

KE Y MESSAGES
Children’s privacy, safety and well-being are at risk due to a lack of oversight of the education technology industry.
Governing education technology is a challenge for governments.


In 82% of countries, there is a government department or agency in charge of education technology. In 48% of
countries, this function is led by the education ministry, in 29% by the education ministry and another ministry, and
in 5% by another ministry altogether.

Public authorities struggle to govern private actors.


Concerns have been raised about lack of oversight of private actors. In India, a government advisory in 2021
cautioned citizens considering education technology purchases not to be misled by deceptive marketing tactics.

Privacy, safety and well-being risks need to be regulated.


Analysis of 163 education technology products recommended for children during the COVID-19 pandemic found
that 89% could or did collect information on children in educational settings or outside school hours.

Data protection legislation is only nascent.


Only 16% of countries guarantee data privacy in education with a law; further analysis of 10 countries found that,
despite this legislation, children’s rights were still not protected.



Schools collect a wealth of data on children and teachers, yet regulations on the use of the data are rare. In the
European Union, public schools are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation and must appoint
data protection officers.



Artificial intelligence algorithms applied in education can reproduce or deepen inequality. In the United States,
an evaluation of 99 developers found the highest rate of false positives in relation to indigenous groups.

Safety risks cannot be dismissed.


Education is increasingly targeted by cyberattacks. In the United States, the number of schools hit by cyberattacks
in 45 districts nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022.



Globally, 16% of countries have adopted legislation to prevent and act on cyberbullying with a focus on education;
of those, 38% have done so since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Exposure to screens and technology affects children’s well-being.


Analysis of children aged 2 to 17 showed that more screen time was associated with lower well-being. In the
United States, 11- to 14-year-olds were estimated to be spending 9 hours a day on a screen. The levels increased
during COVID-19.



Few regulations and guidelines exist for screen time. In China, the Ministry of Education limited time spent with
digital devices as teaching tools to 30% of overall teaching time.

Several countries are banning the use of mobile telephones or other technology in schools.

145



Globally, less than a quarter of countries have laws or policies banning the use of telephones in school.



Some ban the use of specific applications because of privacy concerns. Some states in Germany have banned
Microsoft products that do not comply with the General Data Protection Regulation.

Governments find it challenging to govern education technology. .....................146
Digital privacy, safety and well-being need to be regulated..................................149
Conclusion.............................................................................................................................160

Digital technology provides the infrastructure for modern
societies and economies. Its development, diffusion and
maintenance need to be coordinated across multiple
government departments. Involving the information and
communication technology (ICT) industry needs to be
clearly spelled out in concrete terms through transparent
processes. Governance issues become even more complex
in relation to integrating digital technology in education.
Governments need to make decisions on infrastructure
and carefully consider pedagogy. Education agencies need
to consult with learners and teachers in order to take
decisions in their best interests.
Governments' goals for education equity,
inclusion, quality and efficiency are not necessarily
aligned with those of the education technology
industry. Industry’s profit orientation leads to practices
that can be inappropriate, inequitable, inefficient and
unsustainable – which reduce well-being, breach
security, abuse personal information and even violate
human rights, negating any benefits of applying
technology to education. The increased presence of
technology in daily lives, especially artificial intelligence,
(AI) demands attention to both the right to education and
the right to non-discrimination in and out of school
(Holmes et al., 2022). According to the Special Rapporteur
on the right to privacy, educational processes ‘need not
and should not undermine the enjoyment of privacy and
other rights, wherever or however education occurs’
(United Nations Human Rights Council, 2021).

The goals of governments are not
necessarily aligned with those of the
education technology industry

Preventing such collateral damage is a major new
challenge for regulators all over the world, as digitalization
makes education structures, forms and modes of delivery
ever more complex. Effective protection and promotion
of democracy, human rights and the rule of law needs
collaboration, partnerships and establishing common goals
between many stakeholders at national and international
levels. This chapter focuses on governance and regulation
to ensure users, especially children, are protected when
they use education technology.

GOVERNMENTS FIND IT CHALLENGING
TO GOVERN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY
Education ministries need to collaborate with
economic development, infrastructure, energy and
telecommunications departments in the governance of
education technology use. The respective departments
might have different visions, goals and objectives on
issues such as innovation, digital transformation, and the
storage and use of data. In addition to government actors,
the role of private actors, notably through public–private
partnerships, needs to be clear; this requires transparency
and accountability mechanisms (Hillman, 2022a;
Lingard and Sellar, 2013).
MINISTRIES OF EDUCATION DO NOT ALWAYS LEAD
ON EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY
When considering integrating technology in education, it is
important to make clear which body steers the process.
Ministries of education need to lead such decisions and
pedagogical decisions need to take precedence over
commercial considerations. Learners' best interests may
be at risk where education technology companies do not
come under the jurisdiction of education legislation and are
seen purely through commercial law.

Analysis for this report shows that in 82% of countries,
a government department or agency is in charge of ICT or
education technology: in 48% of countries the education
ministry takes the lead, in 29% the education ministry and
another ministry does so, and in 5% another ministry is the
leader (Figure 8.1). In Armenia, the 2009 general education
law places the responsibility for the introduction and
development of technology in education under the
Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports.
The National Centre for Educational Technologies under
the same ministry has various responsibilities in the field
of ICT deployment, teacher training, ICT integration in
education and data collection.

In other countries, other ministries have a
stronger role. In Bangladesh, the two ministries
responsible for primary and post-primary education,
respectively, share responsibility for coordinating
and implementing ICT in education, including on
curriculum, infrastructure and remote learning
(Bangladesh Ministry of Education, 2013). But the
government also has an ICT Division with a State
Minister and an ICT Adviser to the Prime Minister
with responsibility for national ICT strategy and policy
development and the integration of ICT in various sectors,
including education (Bangladesh ICT Division, 2023).
The ICT Division also leads on cybersecurity laws and
policies, ensuring their implementation alongside the
Digital Security Agency (Bangladesh Digital Security
Agency, 2023). Finally, the Ministry of Science and

147

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

Technology also supports education institutions in its field
(Bangladesh Ministry of Science and Technology, 2019).
In Kenya in 2019, the Ministry of Information,
Communications and Technology issued the
National Information, Communications and Technology
Policy aiming to integrate ICT at all levels of education,
including through the facilitation of public–private
partnerships to mobilize resources for e-learning
initiatives. The Ministry of Education contributed to the
Digital Economy Blueprint in the same year. In Niger,
the governance of education technology is shared
between the Ministry of Post and New Information
Technologies and the Ministry of Education. Within the
latter, the Division for Information Technology Promotion
is responsible for hardware selection, information system
security, data collection for strategic decision making
and ICT integration in education. Since 2017, the National
Agency for the Information Society has also been involved
in the implementation of ICT programmes, for instance
on school mapping. In Palestine, two ministries share
responsibility for the integration of ICT in education:
the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information
Technology and the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education. However, neither has a dedicated ICT
department.
Expert task forces or steering committees
support the quality and coherence of ICT strategy priorities
and coordinate their implementation (Chuang et al., 2022).
The Bhutan Education Blueprint 2014–2024 highlighted
the need for a dedicated governance structure to drive the
implementation of ICT projects. The iSherig-2 Masterplan
2019–2023 recommended establishing a division to
oversee all matters related to ICT in education and a
steering committee comprising representatives from the
education, information and communication, and finance
ministries, as well as project leads from implementing
agencies. In Nepal, two committees were established
under the ICT in Education Master Plan 2013–2017: a
Steering Committee responsible for policy decisions and a
Coordination Committee responsible for overall planning
and intersectoral and inter-agency coordination of the
Master Plan.
In high-income countries, mechanisms have emerged to
strengthen the governance of digital education and the
representation of various stakeholders in policy design,
implementation and monitoring. In Australia, extensive
public consultations have informed the development of the
Digital Strategy (Australian Human Rights Commission,
2021). In Europe, the Digital Education Stakeholder Forum,
organized by the European Commission, has promoted
the engagement of the digital education community in
the implementation of the Digital Education Action Plan

8

(European Commission, 2022). In the United States,
the State Educational Technology Directors Association,
a non-profit association, provides a forum for advocacy
on equity in digital learning. The 2016 National Education
Technology Plan resulted from collaboration between
educators, innovators and researchers who provided
feedback and identified 235 exemplary programmes and
initiatives, 53 of which were included. The Plan’s principles
and examples align with the Activities to Support the
Effective Use of Technology of the Every Student Succeeds
Act (United States Office of Educational Technology, 2016).
However, in 2022, only 41% of education sector leaders
agreed that they were regularly included in planning and
strategic conversations about technology (SETDA, 2022).

Expert task forces or steering committees
support the quality and coherence of ICT
strategy priorities

PUBLIC AUTHORITIES STRUGGLE TO GOVERN
PARTNERSHIPS WITH PRIVATE ACTORS
Quite apart from the challenge of inter-agency
coordination, governments face major new challenges
in establishing governance mechanisms to manage their
relationships with private suppliers. Connectivity, devices,
software and content are expensive to acquire and
maintain. Governments that want to expand their supply
often seek private companies’ assistance. Partnerships
cover such inputs as technical expertise, leasing and
contracting services, training, and in-kind contributions of
equipment and software licences (Pillay and Hearn, 2011).
In Argentina, Educ.ar, a public company launched to
help teachers develop an ICT curriculum and materials,
was established with a private donation in 2000. After
2010, it started overseeing school infrastructure readiness
for the programme Conectar Igualdad (Connecting
Equality) (Roddis et al., 2021). In France, education
technology companies provided resources to schools
under the Territoires numériques éducatifs (Digital
Education Territories), including computers, interactive
screens, whiteboards, speakers, Wi-Fi hotspots and
secure networks (Razquin et al., 2023). In Indonesia,
education technology companies offer services to
students, often under a licence agreement with the
government that allows them to become accredited
education providers, whereby users pay a fee for accessing
the platforms (Razquin et al., 2023). In Saudi Arabia,
Aanaab, an education technology company providing
teacher professional development online and in education

institutions, has started collaborating with the Ministry of
Education to train over 1,000 teachers. Teachers can enrol
for free, although they must pay a fee to receive a training
certificate (Razquin et al., 2023).
There have been some attempts to streamline the
participation of non-state actors in major decisions.
The European EdTech Alliance brings together more
than 2,600 education technology organizations working
‘to support the domestic and international growth of
education technology’ through policy and support to
start-ups. It has developed a vision for sustainable
public–private partnerships and calls for ‘clearly defined
framework architectures determining the scope and
boundaries for co-operations at all levels of the digital
education ecosystem’ (European EdTech Alliance, 2022).
On the whole, however, partnerships between public
authorities and large technology companies are often
controversial, as they can give unfair advantage to the
companies, eventually undermining oversight.
Three types of concerns have been raised about such
partnerships. The first is about violation of privacy
and safety through the use of generated data. Some
technology companies have a stranglehold on data, which
raises concerns over the abuse of data use. In Brazil,
large private education technology vendors, including
Amazon, Google, Huawei, Microsoft and Oracle, have
tried to establish close partnership agreements with
the Ministry of Education, offering free access to their
software. But such agreements may also force students
and teachers to use a particular software, as it might not
be easy to integrate the use of products from different
vendors (Foditsch, 2023). Apple, Google and Microsoft run
educational platforms tied to hardware (e.g. Chromebook,
iPad, Surface) and operating systems (ChromeOS, iOS/
MacOS, Windows), through which they collect information
on users, giving these actors a constant data pipeline.
Governance can be extremely difficult with complex data
pipelines (Chitkara, 2022). The US state of California
approved its Cradle-to-Career Data System Act in 2019 ‘to
link existing education, workforce, financial aid, and social
service information to better equip policymakers,
educators, and the public to address disparities in
opportunities and improve outcomes for all students
throughout the state’ (California Data System, 2019).
The Act requires the integration of data from various
partners, some of which are commercial (DXtera, 2023;
Ed 3.0 Network, 2020; T3 Innovation Network, 2023).
However, the implications of this on governance are under
scrutiny, while it is being asked how to ensure the data
system is managed in an equitable and non-discriminatory
way (EdTrust-West, 2019; Moore, 2020).

The second concern is about the impact of the use of
platforms on essential pedagogical functions. Such
platforms can reduce teacher autonomy by forcing
teachers to use them instead of choosing the tools they
want to use. They can alter student assessment in ways
that suit the interests of profit-seeking technology
providers. They can also define education in ways that
fit big data analyses, shaping content, intended learning
outcomes and their measurement. Gradually, the control
of fundamental pedagogical decisions, which have long
been entrusted to teachers, has moved from the public to
the private domain, without the scrutiny and debate that
has characterized decisions on curriculum and textbooks
(Zeide, 2017).
Consultation is necessary for solutions to also be
pedagogically appropriate. In Germany, the not-for
profit Bündnis für Bildung (Alliance for Education)
brings together education authorities at the federal,
regional and municipal levels with the education industry
to develop joint solutions to digital education challenges.
Working groups are active on issues such as content,
privacy, school transformation and teacher training
(Bündnis für Bildung, 2022).

The business model used by many education
technology companies, which offers free
content, may be a deceptive marketing tactic
The third concern is that consumers could be misled,
and so more traditional market governance is required.
But governments find it challenging to accredit and quality
assure education technology companies. Leaving aside
education technology product purchases by government,
the absence of adequate quality measures, standards and
evaluations is also problematic for the sale of education
technology products to individual consumers (Patel et al.,
2021). The business model used by many education
technology companies, which offers free content, may be
a deceptive marketing tactic, requiring the payment of
a subscription fee. In India, the Department of School
Education and Literacy issued an advisory in 2021 urging
citizens to exercise caution before purchasing education
technology products (India Ministry of Education, 2021).
One response of the education technology
industry was self-regulation. It established the
Indian EdTech Consortium, under the Internet and
Mobile Association of India, an industry body. However,
self-regulation can only succeed with clear long-term
objectives (Thathoo, 2022). In 2022, the Consumer Affairs
Secretary proposed to the Consortium the creation of

149

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

a joint working group to create advertising guidelines
‘to keep unethical practices in communication and
advertisement at bay’ (Press Trust of India, 2022).

DIGITAL PRIVACY, SAFETY AND
WELL-BEING NEED TO BE REGULATED
While digital technology offers excellent opportunities
for teaching and learning, it also comes with risks related
to privacy, safety and well-being – even with copyright
(Box 8.1). The internet – including its use as part of
education – exposes users to misuse of their personal
data, invasion of privacy, abuse, identity theft, offensive
messages and images, cyberbullying, scams, and fake
news and misinformation (Smahel et al., 2020). Concerns
are higher for children exposed to these risks in terms
of their vulnerability and the potential damage caused.
Meanwhile, the excessive use of digital devices has
potential harmful effects on physical and mental health.
PRIVACY IS ROUTINELY VIOLATED FOR
PRIVATE BENEFIT
Digital technology providers, including those producing
education technology products, collect and store data on
their users, including information that is sensitive (Hillman,
2022). Integrating technology in teaching and learning
could therefore compromise students’ privacy. Student
data should not be used either by education technology or
advertising technology companies for marketing purposes
(United Nations Human Rights Council, 2022).
Yet, analysis of 163 education technology products
recommended for children’s learning during the
COVID-19 pandemic found that 89% could or did follow
children in educational settings or outside of school
hours. Tracking technologies installed on learning
platforms collected and sent data on children to
third-party companies, usually advertising technology
companies, that targeted the children with behavioural
advertisements. In most cases, the surveillance took
place without opportunities to opt out and without
consent from children or their parents. Out of
42 governments that provided online education to
children during the pandemic, 39 used digital technology
in ways that ‘risked or infringed’ children's rights. Among
these countries, only Morocco did not endorse any
education technology product that could potentially
undermine children’s rights (Human Rights Watch, 2022).
The right to privacy, generally framed as protection by the
law from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy,
family, home or correspondence, and from unlawful
attacks on honour and reputation, is recognized and
protected as a human right through international legal

8

B OX 8.1:

Intellectual property right issues must be addressed
The initial expectations that digital technology would expand access to content have been dampened (Chapter 3). Yet, as schools and
teachers typically use and create intellectual property, questions arise over ownership and restrictions on the reuse and sharing of
student and teacher work. A study in 15 European countries showed that these issues are often unclear or unaddressed. The copyright
status of education materials varies according to the type of work. Although resources freely available online can, in principle, be used in
the classroom, there may be limits (Nobre, 2017). In the European Union, the right to communicate copyrighted works to the public is in
principle harmonized (Nobre, 2017; Torres and Xalabarder, 2020); four criteria by the Court of Justice of the European Union can be used
to establish the public, non-profit-making character of a communication and its use for education purposes (EUIPO, 2022).
A review of legislation in 18 countries that mentions education in relation to intellectual property and intellectual property rights suggests
it is primarily related to copyright and often targeted at higher education institutions (WIPO, 2022). Yet, clearer regulations are needed
for a broader range of issues, especially while the use of digital teaching and learning tools is increasing. They could cover, for example,
ownership of intellectual property in relation to content produced by teachers and students and the legal standing of sharing content
for educational purposes via email, the cloud and chatrooms. In the Australian state of Victoria, intellectual property policy provides the
framework for the ownership, management and use of intellectual property. The Department of Education manages and uses intellectual
property in accordance with state policy and legislation (Victoria Department of Education, 2021a). The Department guides schools and
teachers on using and sharing copyrighted material. For instance, teachers can use copyrighted material owned by the education or other
government departments and covered under a Creative Commons licence (Victoria Department of Education, 2021b).
In Bangladesh, the Post COVID-19 National ICT Roadmap supported the updating of the intellectual property rights policy to ensure
appropriate encryption and protect the providers of online education. In Singapore, the Ministry of Education eMedia channel for
educators provides a space for teachers to share video projects and lessons that they and their pupils have created. Access is limited to
educators with the appropriate login information.
A survey of European ministries of education in 2015 showed that training on intellectual property was not a priority of national
education plans in 15 countries and not a part of teacher training in 6 countries (Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market, 2015).
An expert network of representatives from education ministries and intellectual property offices was formed to develop a common
approach to intellectual property in education so that creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and the ethical use of protected materials
can influence knowledge and behaviour. The network works with schools and teacher training colleges to raise awareness on intellectual
property issues in education (EUIPO, 2022b). The Ideas Powered@Schools initiative produces and disseminates education materials
aiming to raise the awareness of students on the value of intellectual property and the importance of respecting it (EUIPO, 2022a).

instruments (Right to Education Initiative, 2023). But the
threat to privacy from digital technology is a new territory
for legal experts. The harm from such a privacy violation
is harder to define. It extends into the future. Its negative
consequences are spread across many people, even if they
may be minimal for a single individual. They may cause only
an inconvenience for an individual but bring large benefits
to companies. All of these factors challenge courts’
traditional understandings of harm; legal experts are
just beginning to come to terms with the new terrain
(Citron and Solove, 2022).
Students' privacy must be protected while they are using
technology, while allowing the appropriate use of data
to personalize learning, advance research and visualize
student progress. Schools should be aware of who can
access student data and disclose to families the type
of data that is collected when students use technology
at schools. Schools need to ensure that both parents

and students are aware of and understand their rights
and responsibilities concerning data collection and use
(UNESCO, 2022).
In 2021, a report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the
right to privacy highlighted the lack of protection for
children’s right to privacy in national legal frameworks,
the lack of parents’ and children’s capacity to challenge
vendors’ privacy arrangements or refuse to provide data,
and the fact that schools are not addressing privacy
concerns in relation to their education technology
choices. It noted that companies ‘routinely control
children’s digital educational records’ with such data –
extending to thinking characteristics, learning trajectory,
engagement, response times, pages read, videos viewed,
device identification and location – being shared with
third parties, such as advertising partners. It called for
appropriate legal frameworks for online education
(United Nations Human Rights Council, 2021).

In 2022, a report of the UN Special Rapporteur on
the right to education highlighted that digitalization
of education should not ‘lead to violations of other
human rights within education, in particular the right
to privacy’. It raised concerns about ‘massive imbalance
in power, awareness and knowledge between those
who decide on the technologies and the users’. It also
drew attention to the lack of transparency related to
data collection and use, unclear lines of accountability
for data-based decision-making, an inability to challenge
privacy arrangements in the face of legitimate
concerns, and the potential for student digital records
to adversely impact their employment options.
The report called on countries to adopt and implement
child-specific privacy and data protection laws that
protect the best interests of children in complex online
environments; to protect adults in any educational
setting with privacy and data protection laws; and to
define categories of sensitive personal data that should
never be collected in educational settings, in particular
from children (United Nations Human Rights Council,
2022). Some of these concerns are heightened by
AI (Box 8.2).
In 2021, the Council of Europe issued guidelines for
children’s data protection in an educational setting, based
on four criteria: the best interest of the children, their
evolving capacities, the right to be heard and the right not
to be discriminated against (Council of Europe, 2021).
Data protection legislation is only nascent
Despite the urgent need for it, national legislation has
barely addressed data privacy and security in using
technology in education. With few exceptions, data
protection standards, consumer protection laws and
privacy regulations are still fragmented and opaque,
hampering the coherence or privacy policies for students
and teachers (Right to Education Initiative, 2023). Analysis
of PEER country profiles for this report shows that only
16% of countries guarantee data privacy in education with
a law and 29% with a policy (the countries are mainly in
Europe and Northern America); in 41% of countries, these
policies have been adopted since the COVID-19 pandemic
(Figure 8.2). A further analysis of 10 countries for this

report suggests that even when there are legislative
provisions protecting data privacy and safety, international
human rights law on children's rights to data privacy and
security has not been fully implemented at the national
level (Right to Education Initiative, 2023).
In the European Union, the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), issued in 2016 and which entered into
force in 2018, has changed the legal landscape for
child protection. Article 8 specifies that the processing
of a child’s personal data ‘shall be lawful where the child
is at least 16 years old’. For children under 16, consent
is lawful only if given by the ‘holder of the parental
responsibility’. Member States can propose lower ages
but this should not be below 13 years of age (European
Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016).
In France, parental right holders must
give their consent jointly with that of their child up to
age 15, according to Article 45 of the Data Protection
Act (France Parliament, 2018). Adding countries that
have ratified the GDPR or laws that are compliant to
that regulation outside Europe increases the share of
countries that guarantee data protection, at least in public
schools, from 16% to 31%. In Ireland, which passed a Data
Protection Act in 2018 to enforce the GDPR, the Data
Protection Commission outlined 14 core principles for child
data processing (Ireland Data Protection Commission,
2021).
Other countries that ensure an adequate level of
data protection include Argentina, China, Israel,
Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the
United Kingdom and Uruguay. China’s legal framework
offers strong protection to children's privacy regarding
the sharing of their personal information, including in
an educational environment. Two laws, on the protection
of minors and on the protection of children’s personal
information, are dedicated to children’s digital rights
(China Cyberspace Administration, 2021). In 2021,
the Provisions on the Protection of Minors by Schools
regulated child protection in the use of digital devices
in education, also enshrining principles of equity,
inclusion, respect for dignity and the right to
education (China Ministry of Education, 2021). In Japan,
the Act on Establishment of Enhanced Environment for
Youth’s Safe and Secure Internet Use aims to promote
internet literacy and the use of internet filtering software
on computers and smartphones (Japan Government,
2008). In Latin America, most constitutions recognize
personal data protection rights. However, individual
regulation to protect these rights is lacking. The GDPR
has triggered some initiatives; Colombia and Mexico are
developing new legislation.

In the United States, there is an independent data
authority and a data protection law. Data collection
for children under 13 is governed by the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act, while the Children’s
Internet Protection Act aims to protect children from
obscene or harmful content on the internet in schools
and libraries. Parents, students and school staff have
to sign written agreements, responsible use policies,
which describe consequences for misuse. The Children’s
Internet Protection Act also covers academic integrity
standards and resources that students can or cannot
access when using school-provided devices or the school
network (United States Department of Education, 2017).
Yet, despite all those measures, it does not ensure
adequate data protection (Right to Education Initiative,
2023).
In India, out of some 5,500 complaints received in
2021 by the Advertising Standards Council of India,
one third concerned the education sector
(Financial Express, 2022). Discrepancies between
advertisements and actual products amount to false
advertising (Varshney, 2018). The Department of
Consumer Affairs took note of the alleged fraudulent
selling of courses by some companies (ET Online, 2022).
It advised Byju’s, one of the largest education technology
start-ups, to work with the Council to redress claims it
makes in its advertisements. Concerns have arisen about
complex pricing and financial agreements, and aggressive
marketing and sales strategies (Inamdar, 2021).
In Oman, the 2022 Personal Data Protection Law
determines that personal data should only be processed

with the express written consent of the data owner.
The 2022 Reference Framework for the Use of Educational
Devices in Schools dedicated a section for security
regulations for protecting data privacy in relation to the
use of devices in schools (Oman Ministry of Education,
2022). In Africa in 2020, 24 of 53 countries had
adopted laws and regulations to protect personal data
(PrivacyInternational.org, 2020).
Schools collect a lot of data on students, families and
teachers, some of which are sensitive, including student
biometric and health data, and dietary requirements
that can be used to make assumptions about religion.
In Europe, public schools are covered as ‘public authorities’
by the GDPR. They must appoint data protection officers,
who are more accountable for the data they collect. When
data are handled by third parties, schools should ensure
that these are GDPR-compliant and that transactions
occur within a legally binding contract. Data breaches that
negatively impact data subjects need to be reported to
the data protection authority within 72 hours. The GDPR
also determines how and when such data can be lawfully
processed; for example, there is a lawful basis for schools
to process data and this task is in the public interest.
But even so, the data cannot be recycled for another task.
If schools want to share student data, they need to seek
parental or student consent.

B OX 8.2:

Artificial intelligence presents additional risks for privacy
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is expanding at an exponential rate, spanning from the automation of administrative
processes and tasks to curriculum and content development, teaching, and learning. But a section dedicated to education and research in
the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the first with a global reach, describes tangible and intangible
risks and calls for a robust policy and legislative framework along with ethical oversight (UNESCO, 2021).
AI is largely based on machine learning algorithms, which are used to make decisions that can have a major impact on people’s lives. Far
from being fair and objective, algorithms carry the biases of their developers and can reproduce or deepen inequality, especially in terms
of discrimination (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2022). The issue of fairness has been a challenge in assessment for a
long time (Hutchinson and Mitchell, 2019) and is included among international organizations’ core principles for trustworthy AI
(European Commission, 2019; OECD, 2019).
Applied in different domains, including health, justice and the labour market, algorithms are also applied in education, for instance to
admit students (Engler, 2021) and predict dropout probabilities (Sybol et al., 2023) and grades (Yağcı, 2022). When examinations had
to be suspended in the United Kingdom due to COVID-19, algorithms were used to predict scores, which had grave consequences.
Public school students received grades lower than what they expected and lower than those in smaller private schools, leading to major
questions about accountability and the ethics of such predictive systems (Kolkman, 2020). AI does not consider student's real experiences
and contexts, exhibiting gender, racial and other biases (Baker and Hawn, 2022; Borgesius, 2018; Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018).
Facial recognition systems can also be biased against specific races (Garvie and Frankle, 2016). An evaluation in the United States of
189 software algorithms from 99 developers yielded higher rates of false positives for Asian and African Americans relative to images
of Caucasians by ‘a factor of 10 to 100 times, depending on the individual algorithm’. The highest rates of false positives were found
in relation to indigenous peoples (NIST, 2019). In Brazil, facial recognition has been used to monitor access to public services, including
schools, with the aim to monitor student attendance. However, the programmes collect other information and can monitor and record
information on excluded and marginalized groups at the expense of privacy. As a recently approved law for data protection does not cover
data processing for public security purposes, these systems could be used to profile and punish already vulnerable groups (Canto, 2021).
In the US state of Texas, at least eight school districts use facial recognition that is also used for law enforcement purposes (Simonite
and Barber, 2019). They justify the use of facial recognition systems in schools that could identify every student entering and leaving the
classroom by arguing that the systems can also ‘recognize students’ behaviours such as [being in a] daze, dozing, and playing with mobile
phones’ (Jin, 2019). China’s Cyberspace Administration and the Ministry of Education introduced regulations in 2019 requiring parental
consent before cameras and headbands powered by AI are used with students and requiring data to be encrypted (UNESCO, 2021).

In many countries, there are no specific regulations yet
on how and when the sharing of children’s personal
information is lawful. Consent for data processing may
not be valid even when it is requested, as children or
parents may not be able to refuse it when it is necessary
for education or when they do not understand the basis
for consent (European Data Protection Board, 2020).
There may be confusion on whether existing standards
of consent apply to schools. In the United Kingdom,
the Information Commissioner’s Office has issued the
age-appropriate design code, which applies to online
services likely to be accessed by children. The code
contains 15 standards to be followed by online services
(United Kingdom Information Commissioner’s Service,
2021). However, these are not applied to services for
children carried out by education technology providers
through schools (Digital Futures Commission, 2022).

153

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

In South Africa, the Guidelines on e-Safety in Schools
include a provision on monitoring software, stating that
learners and teachers must be informed at the outset that
their online activity is being monitored. The purpose is to
provide a safe online environment which educates users
on how to manage their access and online behaviour and
ensures the behaviour does not overstep the bounds of
reasonable respect for privacy. Schools’ acceptable use
policy specifies that learners need to be informed about
what data are captured by the monitoring software,
how long the data are kept, who has access to the data,
how the data will be kept safe so that unauthorized users
cannot access it, what mechanisms exist to ensure the
data are accurate, and how the data can be used
(South Africa Department of Basic Education, 2017).

8

Recent investigations have generated government
responses, such as the removal of advertising tracking
from learning platforms (France, Indonesia, the state
of Minas Gerais in Brazil) and opening investigations
into learning platforms (the Australian states of
New South Wales and Victoria, Ecuador and Spain’s
autonomous community of Catalonia) (Human Rights
Watch, 2023).
While the provisions described here are a step forward
in protecting children from risks associated with the
online processing of their personal information, they are
grounded in an approach based on risks rather than rights.
Moreover, they do not provide the same assurances as
human rights or child rights due diligence processes.
Supervision and oversight must ensure that education
technology companies adhere to standards and do not
extend their power without limits. Complaint mechanisms
and administrative or judicial remedies tend not to be
tailored for children. Australia, Brazil, France, Ireland,
Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom have
entrusted a regulatory authority with the power
to bring administrative actions against parties who have
committed a breach of data laws. But the extent to which
they can investigate, impose civil liability and issue fines
varies by country. Article 69 of the Chinese Personal
Information Protection Law puts the burden of proof on
the handlers of personal information, making them liable
to the extent that they cannot prove they are not at fault.
However, the mechanism is complex and it may still be
difficult to make such actors accountable
(Right to Education Initiative, 2023).
In cases of infringements of privacy and data protection,
administrative fines must be effective, proportional and
dissuasive. In Iceland, the Supervisory Authority ruled that
a US cloud-based education company breached the GDPR
by not obtaining parental consent for processing student
data from one of Reykjavík’s primary schools and
issued an ISK 5 million (USD 38,000) fine
(European Data Protection Board, 2022). A fine was
imposed by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority
on the Municipality of Oslo for poor security in a mobile
app used for communication between school employees,
parents and pupils (European Data Protection Board,
2019). The Swedish Data Protection Authority, reviewing
the platform of the Stockholm school administration, found
that the level of security was insufficient, affected ‘several
hundred thousand’ data subjects – including children
and pupils – and did not adequately handle sensitive and
special categories of personal data. The authority issued a

fine of SEK 4 million (USD 390,000) to the Stockholm Board
of Education (Stockholm Board of Education, 2020).
Education technology companies can play an important
role in privacy and data protection by applying sound
privacy and data protection to their products, service
and systems. In some cases, this amounts to setting the
privacy by default in applications and devices, and not
requiring manual input from the user (UNESCO, 2022).
Users need instead to opt in to being tracked by third-party
applications, as is the case with Apple’s operating system
iOS 14.5. In a survey in the United States, only 13% of
users had granted permission for tracking by any apps
and 4% had set themselves so they cannot be asked to
opt-in (Laziuk, 2021). Alternatively, companies can ensure
privacy by design. The GDPR establishes ‘data protection
by design’ as a legal requirement to be fulfilled.
Article 83 considers non-compliance with this obligation
as a punishable offence and its correct application is one of
the criteria for measuring the gravity of an infringement.
Education technology services and products need to
make the privacy and human rights implications deriving
from their use fully understandable. Yet providers seek
exemptions. In the Netherlands, Google proposed changing
the contractual privacy commitments for service data
after the government carried out a data protection
impact assessment of Google Workspace for Education
(Bonamigo, 2021). However, the ban was not lifted (Rao,
2022). Even where online child protection exists, it is
sometimes discontinuous across settings. Protection
offered on services or applications used in schools does
not necessarily continue when children are at home doing
their homework, resulting in their data being captured
by other providers and vendors and used afterwards for
behavioural profiling and social scoring (Digital Futures
Commission, 2022).
SAFETY RISKS CANNOT BE DISMISSED
Education, like all sectors, is increasingly targeted by
cyberattacks. Schools possess confidential data about
students and parents ranging from socio-demographic
to health records and financial information; all need to
be protected. More attacks on education systems and
users mean more exposure to theft of identity and other
personal data. In the United States, the number of schools
impacted by cyberattacks in 45 districts nearly doubled
between 2021 and 2022 (Emsisoft, 2023). Globally,
in 2022, the education sector accounted for 5% of all
ransomware attacks (Anti-Phishing Working Group, 2022)
and more than 30% of security breaches (Verizon, 2022).

The global cost of cybercrime was estimated
at USD 7 trillion in 2022
The global cost of cybercrime was estimated at
USD 7 trillion in 2022 (Morgan, 2022). The costs and
risks of poor cybersecurity in schools are large even
though ransoms are often not paid. Besides loss of data
and work, these costs include increased student and
teacher data exposure, and the downtime and restoration
of key systems and resources. In the United States,
in 2022, the cost to schools and colleges of downtime
was estimated at USD 9.5 billion (Bischoff, 2023) and the
average data breach cost in education at USD 3.9 million
in 2022 (IBM, 2022). The average cost of a ransom attack
in 2,700 universities across 43 countries was estimated
at around USD 447,000 (Bluevoyant, 2021) and the
average cost to educational institutions to re-establish the
conditions pre-attack was an average of USD 2.7 million
in 2021 in the United States, much higher than in other
sectors (Shier, 2021). A 2021 survey of 5,400 information
technology decision makers in 30 countries, including
500 from the education sector, showed that 44% of
organizations were hit by ransomware in 2020, with 58% of
those suffering from data encryption. More than one third
of those that experienced data encryption paid an average
ransom of USD 112,000. Even paying the ransom helped
recover only 68% of data (Sophos, 2021).
Governments need to develop appropriate legal and policy
frameworks to protect and safeguard digital infrastructure
and data from cyberattacks. They can adopt strong
acceptable use policies that clearly define appropriate
and inappropriate uses of technology and consequences
for violating them. Increasing exposure to cybersecurity
risks also calls for raising awareness and informing
teachers, students and families. Establishing a collective
defence model, based on a community of defenders and
collaboration between multiple stakeholders to protect
education systems from threats, was a critical component
of the 2021 K-12 Cybersecurity Act in the United States.
Cyberbullying is a growing concern for safety and well-being
Cyberbullying is a new form of bullying behaviour, which
is fuelled by access to smartphones and other devices.
Globally, 16% of countries have adopted legislation to
prevent and act on it with a focus on education; of those,
38% have done so since the COVID-19 pandemic. About

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

40% of countries have a policy, strategy or plan in this
area. Europe and Northern America is the region with
the highest share of countries – 61% – with such a policy
(Figure 8.3).
Most countries do not explicitly define cyberbullying and
online abuse as a distinct offence, as those behaviours
may fall under other laws (Right to Education Initiative,
2023). In Australia, various legislative tools at central,
state and territory levels criminalize stalking, intimidating
or threatening conduct, encouraging suicide, defamation,
and accessing online accounts without authorization.
The 2021 Online Safety Act defines cyberbullying material
as something that can seriously humiliate, harass,
intimidate or threaten a child and grants the Office of
the eSafety Commissioner the power to require online
service providers to remove the material and manage
complaints for Australians under 18 who experience
cyberbullying. The 2022 Personal Data Protection Act is
the first comprehensive data protection law in Indonesia.
It calls upon public or private entities that handle personal
data to ensure data protection, with sanctions applied for
mishandling. Protection against cyberbullying is indirectly
provided under the Act. However, Article 45B of the
amended 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions
Law considers cyberbullying a form of harassment.
In Japan, the Act for the Promotion of Measures to Prevent
Bullying, which does not separate online and offline
bullying, stipulates the obligations of national and local
governments, schools, teachers, and parents regarding
the prevention and early detection of and responses
to bullying. China has specific provisions regarding
cyberbullying. Articles 77 and 80 of the 2020 Law on
the Protection of Minors provide that ‘no organization
or individual should insult, slander, or threaten minors,
maliciously damage the image of minors, or conduct other
cyberbullying acts against minors through the internet
in the form of text, picture, audio and video’. They also
establish the obligation of network service providers to
act in a timely manner after receiving notification from the
cyberbullying victim to stop these acts and prevent the
spread of information, including by deleting, blocking and
disconnecting links, as well as to keep relevant records
and report the cyberbullying to the relevant authorities
(Right to Education Initiative, 2023).

In Bangladesh, cyberbullying is punishable under the
2006 ICT Act, amended in 2013, but there is no explicit link
with education or schools. The 2012–21 Master Plan for
ICT in Education supports special measures to protect the
confidentiality of students, teachers and administrators
who use technology. The draft 2022 Data Protection
Act is the first legislation in the country focused on data
privacy and protection. The draft Act does not mention
education but refers to child online protection in general.
In India, the Information Technology Act can be considered
a legal basis for dealing with cyberbullying. It prescribes
punishment for sending annoying, offensive and
insulting communication through digital and information
communication technology. Cyberbullying could also
fall under the Penal Code if it involves offences such as
defamation, blackmail, sexual harassment, stalking or
words, gestures and acts intended to ‘insult the modesty
of a woman’. However, no special protection is granted to
children under those laws.
EXCESSIVE TECHNOLOGY USE PUTS PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL WELL-BEING AT RISK
The use of technology involves prolonged periods of time
spent handling devices and facing screens. Education is
particularly vulnerable to excesses in both respects, which
exacerbates the risks to health and general well-being;
governments are only now beginning to consider how to
respond to these risks.

Exposure to screens affects children’s well-being
The amount of time children spend on screens is a
growing concern for parents as well as for education and
health practitioners. In the United States, the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention estimated daily screen
time at 6 hours for 8- to 10-year-olds, 9 hours for 11to 14-year-olds (of which 5 were watching television)
and 7.5 hours for 15- to 18-year-olds (CDC, 2018).
These levels increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A survey of screen time before and after the pandemic of
2,500 parents with 3- to 8-year-old children in Australia,
China, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United
States found that children’s screen exposure increased
by 50 minutes as a result of both education and leisure.
A lower socio-economic status was associated with
greater increases (Ribner et al., 2021).
There were differences between countries. In 19 European
countries, children aged between 9 and 16 years spent
2 hours and 47 minutes online on average in 2020, from
a low of 2 hours and 14 minutes in Switzerland to a high
of 3 hours and 39 minutes in Norway. Compared with
data collected in 2010, this time has doubled in countries
including France, Italy and Spain. Children aged 15 to
16 years spend nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes daily
online, compared with nearly 2 hours for those aged 9 to
11 years and 3 hours and 12 minutes for those aged 12 to
14 (Smahel et al., 2020). In France, even children under
2 spent 3 hours and 11 minutes daily in front of screens in
2022 (Le Point, 2023).

Concerns about screen time were discussed well before
the advent of computers and screen-based digital devices.
But earlier studies’ results were often inconclusive
because of the self-reporting of screen time, which can be
affected by recall errors and bias (Wong et al., 2021).
More recent studies tend to report negative impacts in
various domains. A review of 89 studies on screen time
in various countries and regions suggests that while all
age groups recorded increases in screen time, primary
school children had the biggest daily increase (by 1 hour
and 23 minutes), followed by adults (58 minutes),
adolescents (55 minutes) and children under
5 (35 minutes). The increases negatively affected diet
(e.g. eating self-regulation), sleep, mental health and eye
health (Trott et al., 2022).
In the United Kingdom, some estimates suggest
that 40% of 11- to 16-year-olds had experienced back
or neck pain and 15% of parents said this likely resulted
from the use of laptops, tablets or computers
(Sayer Clinics, 2014). A report based on the findings of
12 systematic reviews found an association between
more screen time and a less healthy diet, a higher energy
intake and more pronounced indicators of obesity. More
than 2 hours a day of screen time is associated with more
depressive symptoms, poorer educational outcomes, loss
of sleep and fitness. Children and youth between the ages
of 11 and 24 were spending approximately 2.5 hours on
the computer, 3 hours on their phone and 2 hours on the
television per day (Viner et al., 2019).
Analysis of a large sample of young people aged between
2 and 17 in the United States showed that higher screen
time was associated with poorer well-being; less curiosity,
self-control and emotional stability; higher anxiety;
and depression diagnoses. Some of these associations
were larger for adolescents than young children
(Twenge and Campbell, 2018). A study of early childhood
development among 2,441 mothers and children in the
Canadian province of Alberta found that higher levels
of screen time in children aged 24 and 36 months were
associated with worse development outcomes at 36 and
60 months, respectively (Madigan et al., 2019). A similar
result was reported in a study of 52 children aged 3 to
5, which used brain scans to analyse brain structure
according to each child’s digital media use. It found that
higher media use was associated with lower cortical
thickness and sulcal depth. These two characteristics
are linked to language development, reading skills and
social skills, such as complex memory encoding, empathy,
and understanding facial and emotional expression
(Hutton et al., 2022).

157

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

Experts are increasingly calling for public interventions
and limits to screen time (Nagata et al., 2022).
A meta-analysis covering 12 cohort studies and
15 cross-sectional studies on a sample of 25,000
children aged between 6 and 18 years argued for public
interventions to promote outdoor activities to reduce the
risk of myopia (Duraipandy et al., 2021). An experimental
study on two sets of grade 6 students from a school in the
US state of California found that those who went on a trip
to a nature camp and were not allowed to use any type
of digital device did substantially better at interpreting
human emotions than those who continued spending time
on digital devices (Uhls et al., 2014) .

Experts are increasingly calling for public
interventions and limits to screen time
Despite the risks of screen time, there are few strict
regulations. In China, the Ministry of Education placed
a limit of 30% of overall teaching time spent with digital
devices as teaching tools and at most 20 minutes per day
spent on electronic homework. Guidelines also suggest
students should rest their eyes for 10 minutes after 30 to
40 minutes of educational screen time (Wong et al., 2021).
The government has set strict limitations on gaming
too, at three hours maximum per week, placing some
responsibility on gaming companies (Soo, 2021). Games
require all users to register using their real names
(Feiner and Kharpal, 2021) and government-issued
identification documents (Zhang, 2021).
In the Republic of Korea, until recently, children
up to age 15 were forbidden to play video games
during the night, a provision enshrined in the 2011
Youth Protection Revision Act, which was abolished
in 2021. The Department of Education of the US state
of Minnesota passed a law in 2022 stating that public
preschool and kindergarten students cannot use
screens alone without teacher engagement
(Minnesota Department of Education, 2021).
Guidelines or recommended screen time limits exist,
most often under the purview of health authorities,
but it is up to the parents to follow them. The World
Health Organization guidelines on physical activity,
sedentary behaviours and sleep recommends less than an
hour of sedentary screen time for children aged between
1 and 5 years (WHO, 2019). In Australia, the 24-Hour
Movement Guidelines for Children recommend: no screen
time for children under 2 years; no more than one hour

8

per day for 2- to 5-year-olds; and no more than two hours
of sedentary recreational screen time per day for 5- to
17-year-olds (not including schoolwork). But only 17% to
23% of preschoolers and 15% of 5- to 12-year-olds met
these guidelines (Joshi and Hinkley, 2021).
Some countries are recommending negotiation rather
than imposing strict limits. In Canada, guidelines by the
Canadian Paediatric Society highlight four principles –
minimizing, mitigating, mindful usage and modelling
healthy use of screens – to move away from screen time
limits, which can be a major source of stress for parents
and children (Ponti, 2022). A similar approach is found in
the United Kingdom, where the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health has published guidelines to help parents
manage children’s screen time through dialogue
(Viner et al., 2019). In 2020, the Ministry of National
Education, Children and Youth of Luxembourg and the
BEE SECURE initiative set up the campaign, Screens in
the Family, to promote parental awareness of reasonable
screen use (Luxembourg Ministry of National Education,
Childhood and Youth, 2020; Luxembourg Ministry of
National Education Childhood and Youth and
BEE SECURE, 2022).

Several countries are banning telephones or other
technology from schools
Concerns over data privacy, safety and well-being also
underpin debates about the use of some technology in
schools, especially by students at young ages. The use
of smartphones in schools is contentious. Studies
from Belgium (Baert et al., 2020), Spain (Beneito and
Vicente-Chirivella, 2020) and the United Kingdom (Beland
and Murphy, 2016) show that banning mobile phones from
schools improves academic performance, especially for
low-performing students.
Analysis for this report shows that, globally, almost one in
four countries has introduced such bans in laws or policies.
In particular, 13% of countries have laws and 14% have
policies that ban mobile phones. Bans are more common in
Central and Southern Asia (Figure 8.4). In 2011, Bangladesh
imposed a ban on the use of mobile phones by teachers
in classrooms (Samad, 2011). In 2017, both students
and teachers in schools and colleges were banned from
bringing mobile phones into classrooms (bdnews24, 2017).
Article 25 of the education law in Tajikistan states that the
use of mobile phones by students is prohibited in primary,
vocational and secondary schools. In Uzbekistan, the law
calls for switching off all devices when entering schools.

The Department of Education in the Australian state
of New South Wales implemented a restriction on
mobile devices in public primary schools in 2018
(New South Wales Government, 2020), while mobile
phones are prohibited for all public school students in
Tasmania (Tasmania Government Ministry of Education
and Training, 2019) and Victoria (Gullaci, 2019). Yet a poll
of 1,070 people in Australia found that 2 in 3 respondents
strongly or somewhat supported implementing digital
safety programmes to educate students on how to safely
use mobile phones rather than banning all students from
using mobile phones in schools. More than half supported
or somewhat supported a ban for all students, while
37% supported or somewhat supported only grade 11
and 12 students using mobile phones in school
(Essential Research, 2022).
France has a ban but makes exceptions for certain
groups of students (e.g. with disabilities) or when
smartphones are used for ‘pedagogical’ purposes
(France Ministry of National Education, 2018). Full or
partial bans have been imposed in Latvia, Mexico, Portugal,
Spain, Switzerland and the United States, as well as in
Ontario (Canada) and Scotland (United Kingdom). But in the
Republic of Korea, a watchdog argued that a complete ban
would infringe on students' basic rights, such as freedom
of communication (Hyo-jyn, 2021).

Working with technology in schools, and the
accompanying risks, may require something
more than banning
In Burkina Faso, a 2018 order prohibits the use of mobile
phones and accessories within secondary schools under
penalty of confiscation, with equipment held and not
returned to the student until the end of the school year.
The use of devices other than those authorized for the
course or assessment is prohibited and the student will
be temporarily or permanently excluded in the event of
a repeat offence. In Côte d’Ivoire, a ministerial decree
prohibits the use of mobile phones in schools, while a
2018 order prohibits digital communication media during
examinations. In Guinea, a 2021 decision bans the use of
smartphones and any other internet-connected devices
in schools.

C H A P T E R 8 • G overnance and regulation

Countries have banned the use of specific applications
from education settings because of the privacy concerns
they raise when they collect user data unnecessary for
the applications to work. In Denmark, a data protection
impact assessment conducted by the Helsingør
municipality in relation to Google Workspace for Education
and Chromebooks led to banning their use in schools
(Schmiedt, 2022). France’s Ministry of Education and Youth
has banned free versions of Microsoft Office 365 and
Google Workspace in schools (UC Today, 2022). In Germany,
Microsoft products have been banned in the states of
Baden-Württemberg and Hessen because they do not
comply with the GDPR (Schneider, 2022). The Dutch Data
Protection Authority proposed to ban Chromebooks and
Google Workspace for Education from schools until August
2023 because of non-compliance with children’s data
protection and privacy regulations (Toulas, 2022).
Several schools and universities in the United States
have also started banning TikTok and other platforms
(Ksetri, 2023). An executive order published in March
2023 highlights the importance of technology to the
nation’s ‘security, economy, and democracy’ while also
ensuring that ‘technology is developed, deployed,
and governed in accordance with universal human
rights; the rule of law; and appropriate legal
authorization, safeguards, and oversight’
(United States Presidency, 2023).
Banning technology from schools can be legitimate if
technology integration does not improve learning or if it
worsens student well-being. Yet, working with technology
in schools, and the accompanying risks, may require
something more than banning. First, policies should be
clear on what is and is not permitted in schools. Students
cannot be punished if there is no clarity or transparency
on their required behaviour. Decisions in these areas need
conversations supported by sound evidence and involve
all those with a stake in students’ learning. Second, there
should be clarity on the role these new technologies play
in learning and on their responsible use by and within
schools. Third, students need to learn the risks and
opportunities that come with technology, develop critical
skills, and understand to live with and without technology.
Shielding students from new and innovative technology
can put them at a disadvantage. It is important to look at
these issues with an eye on the future and be ready to
adjust and adapt as the world changes.

CONCLUSION
Technology has fundamentally changed the way in
which children exercise and realize their rights, including
their rights to both education and privacy. While under
certain conditions the use of technology in education can
enhance children’s opportunity to learn, it can also put
their physical and mental integrity, privacy, and dignity at
risk. Issues related to intellectual property, data privacy
and online safety are critical challenges that countries
need to address.
In addition to digital education strategies, many countries,
primarily high-income ones, have issued data protection
laws or regulations following the GDPR. Yet they do
not often distinguish between adults and children with
respect to the treatment of personal data. As children
deserve special protection, child data protection laws
and standards, and accountability mechanisms tailored
to children, are increasingly needed. Policymakers should
listen to the voices of children so that their rights are
protected and safeguarded during their online activities.
Sound education technology and data governance are
essential to make technology benefits more equitable
and of quality while ensuring that schools are a safe place
for children to learn, play, develop and thrive. Achieving
that aim implies setting clear frameworks, effective
regulations, oversight and dispute resolution mechanisms.
The right to education and the right to privacy need to
be monitored and protected in a world where billions of
people are connected and exchange data and information
as they are learning.

KE Y MESSAGES
Any potential that technology has will not be realized unless teachers are prepared to use it.
Technology-based practices and resources are changing the teaching profession.


Options for working with multiple teaching and assessment resources and for interacting with students
accelerated during COVID-19. A survey of teachers in 165 countries found that 27% used technology daily to
assess students during the pandemic.

Various barriers prevent teachers from making the most of what technology has to offer.


Teachers often do not take part in decisions on technology: 45% of teachers in 94 countries reported not being
consulted about new technology they had to work with.



Age is believed to negatively affect teachers’ technology skills but research with teachers in 17 countries showed
that resistance to technology was related more to preparation than to age.



Some teachers are hesitant or lack confidence in using technology. Lower secondary school teachers who took part
in the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey reported that ICT was their second highest training priority.
Even after training, only 43% felt prepared to use technology for teaching.



Many teachers are critical of technology. Among grade 8 teachers surveyed in the 2018 International Computer
and Information Literacy Study, 37% felt that technology distracted students from learning.

Education systems are taking steps to define development needs.


Self-assessment tools support teachers in identifying their development needs.



Around half of countries have ICT standards for teachers and about one fifth of those countries have specified or
readjusted them since the COVID-19 pandemic.



New ICT training topics are being introduced, including how to respond to plagiarism and how to safely share
students’ work online.

Technology is changing teacher training.


Technology can make training opportunities more accessible, overcoming location and time barriers. Distance
education programmes have been found to promote teacher learning in mathematics in South Africa and even to
equal the impact of in-person training in Ghana.



Teachers can use technology to learn from each other. About 80% of more than 1,500 teachers surveyed in the
Caribbean belong to professional WhatsApp groups and 44% use WhatsApp and similar messaging applications to
collaborate at least once a week.



Technology can facilitate coach and mentor involvement. In Senegal, face-to-face coaching improved teaching
practices more, but online coaching cost 83% less and still improved the way teachers guided their students’
reading practice.

Many education actors support teacher professional development in ICT.


163

Head teachers are generally responsible for setting conditions for ICT integration into schools. But according to the
2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study, only some 40% of students attended schools whose
head teachers considered it a priority to encourage teachers to integrate ICT into their teaching.

eachers are increasingly expected to integrate
technology into various aspects of their professional
practice, including their pedagogy, student assessment,
interactions with students and parents, and professional
development. Effective integration means enabling
teachers to make their teaching practices more
learner-centred; creating engaging and relevant
learning environments; and preparing students with
technological knowledge and skills. However, despite these
expectations, teachers receive varying levels of support
to improve their skills in information and communication
technology (ICT), and use them to teach. Many teachers
remain hesitant or lack confidence in using technology.
The COVID-19 disruption increased the working hours and
learning needs of teachers who worked remotely, as well
as the expectations on them, but training responses have
been uneven.

Many teachers remain hesitant or lack
confidence in using technology
Taking these challenges as a starting point, this chapter
describes education system responses to help teachers
use technology in various areas of their practice, with
a focus on effective professional development which
integrates technology. The chapter is based on the premise
that technology cannot replace teachers in the classroom.
Teachers not only impart knowledge and instruction,
but also socialize students and act as motivational role
models, which technology alone cannot do. They also
encourage critical thinking and autonomy in students.
Teacher development in and through technology should
recognize and enable teachers to act as creators, designers
and facilitators, particularly in relation to the appropriate
choice of technology to respond to the diversity of
learners’ needs and contexts.

TECHNOLOGY-BASED PRACTICES
AND RESOURCES ARE CHANGING THE
TEACHING PROFESSION
As new applications and technologies make their way into
classrooms around the world (Chapter 4), the teaching
profession is adapting to and changing with the education
landscape. More opportunities arise for student-centred
learning, access to multiple curriculum and assessment
resources, and frequent interactions with students and
parents. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated some of
these trends, requiring teachers to adjust the curriculum,
prioritize learning that can be done online, and rethink their
assessment methods accordingly.
Effective use of education technology by teachers
can strengthen the extent to which they can facilitate
student-centred learning, including through project-based
activities. Platforms using algorithms and adaptive
learning technologies can provide personalized learning
experiences for students. Although a precise definition
of personalized learning remains elusive, the main idea is
that such approaches provide teachers with data-driven
insights about students’ strengths and weaknesses,
offering them a range of new tools to support their
teaching, and helps them identify areas where students
need additional support and adjusted teaching strategies.
Such approaches also allow teachers to adopt more flexible
teaching schedules and to provide students with more
opportunities for self-directed learning (Walkington and
Bernacki, 2020). For instance, Khan Academy interactive
exercises and video lessons use adaptive learning
technology to provide students with customized learning
paths that have been found to promote personalization
(Vidergor and Ben-Amram, 2020).

Virtual and augmented reality technologies can help
teachers find new ways to explain concepts and provide
students with more engaging ways to delve into subject
matter through game-based learning and simulated
real-world scenarios, such as virtual field trips (Lan et al.,
2018; Lu and Liu, 2015; Pellas et al., 2019; Tobar-Muñoz
et al., 2017).

Teachers are more and more supported
through technology to select, adapt and
produce teaching resources
Teachers are more and more supported through
technology to select, adapt and produce teaching
resources. In France, the government facilitated access
to 17 online teaching resource banks mapped against
the national curriculum in all disciplines and grades. They
also offered teachers the possibility of adapting these
resources according to student profiles and needs. Within
two weeks of the start of the pandemic, the government
disabled all authentication requirements and the collection
of personal data through its platforms, making it easier
for teachers, as well as for students and their families,
to access the resources (Thillay et al., 2022). In the
Republic of Korea, nearly 60% of the resources found on
the School-On website exchange platform are created by
teachers. During the pandemic, the Ministry of Culture,
Sports and Tourism also temporarily relaxed copyright
rules to allow teachers to produce online course content
using existing resources (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2022).
France Education International, under the supervision of
the French Ministry of National Education, developed the
Imagin’Ecole platform during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With support from UNESCO and the Global Partnership
for Education, this platform brings together several digital
resources, enabling teachers to produce, modify or share
teaching scenarios and to disseminate them at the local or
regional level. The resources submitted are then integrated
into teaching sessions and learning paths adapted to
national programmes and country needs (France Education
International, 2022).
The CL4STEM project aims to assist newly qualified
science, technology and mathematics teachers in Bhutan,
Nigeria and the United Republic of Tanzania to select,
integrate and adapt the resources of the Connected
Learning Initiative, or CLIx, an open educational platform
from India, and other open educational resources into their
national curricula to ensure inclusive technology education
(Connected Learning Initiative, 2023).

C H A P T E R 9 • T eachers

Education systems are providing access to assessment
tools, which can help teachers save time, provide
immediate feedback to students, and gain new insights
into their students’ learning. Key initiatives support
teachers in their use of online quizzes and tests, learning
management systems, video recording tools, digital
portfolios, automated assessment tools that use artificial
intelligence to automatically mark students' work,
and collaborative tools to facilitate group work and
peer assessment.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many teachers had to
adapt assessment to what technology could – or could
not – do. According to T4, an online survey of more than
20,000 teachers in 165 countries, 27% of teachers used
technology to assess students during the pandemic
on a daily basis, 29% did so weekly, and 20% once or
twice a month (Pota et al., 2021). Over 60% of teachers
responding to the Responses to Educational Disruption
(REDS) International Survey reported they had to adapt
assessment practices commonly used before the
disruption, particularly for students with special needs
and in more practical subjects, to fit the new mode of
delivery (Meinck et al., 2022). In some countries, teachers
were given autonomy to assess students in the ways
they felt most appropriate. In Slovenia, two fifths of
primary and one third of secondary teachers adjusted their
assessment methods, with many reporting a greater use
of quizzes (Slovenia National Education Institute, 2020).
In Israel, teachers in the Kibbutzim College of Education
introduced new forms of assessments, based on student
blogs, interactive digital posters, digital portfolios, mind
maps, online presentations and videos (Donitsa-Schmidt
and Ramot, 2020).
Technology provides teachers with a variety of tools and
platforms to boost interaction with students and parents.
These include online communication tools such as email,
messaging applications and discussion forums
(e.g. for quick messages, questions and answers) as
well as online platforms such as forums, chat rooms and
video conferencing tools (e.g. to manage and distribute
course materials online). Some teachers also use
social media platforms, often on a voluntary basis,
to share updates and information with students
and parents. Teacher–student interactions using
messaging applications were encouraged during
COVID-19 (International Task Force on Teachers for
Education 2030, 2020).
In Costa Rica, the Ministry of Public Education,
the Directorate of Technological Resources for Education
and the Directorate of Management Information
Systems have implemented a secure collaboration
platform between teachers and students. This platform

9

provides access to a helpdesk for information requests
and integrated email accounts that allow teachers and
students to create work teams, participate in virtual
sessions, share teaching materials, and evaluate
and create e-portfolios. In August 2020, there were
665,000 active users, and almost three quarters of them
were still active when in-person courses resumed in
October 2021 (Ripani, 2022).
Teachers use technology to communicate with parents
and the community. The REDS International Survey
found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, among teachers
engaging in remote teaching, more than two thirds of
those in India, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, the
United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan, and more than half
of those in Burkina Faso, Denmark and Ethiopia, had spent
more time communicating with parents than before the
pandemic (Meinck et al., 2022). Overall, more interactions
with students and parents can help strengthen
relationships and improve learning outcomes. But teachers
need to learn how to use these tools appropriately and
be aware of privacy and security issues when sharing
information online.
Overall, evidence on the impact of teacher practices
integrating technology on student learning is relatively
limited (Allier-Gagneur et al., 2020). Among the 170 studies
on technology-based teacher professional development
programmes in low- and middle-income countries
reviewed for this report, only 5% tried to measure training
impact on student knowledge and skills (Hennessy et al.,
2023), leaving a gap in the knowledge of how to design
such programmes well.

Teachers in low- and middle-income countries have lower
levels of access to devices and software. In Punjab, India,
nearly 8 out of 10 teachers reported outdated computers
in ICT laboratories and poor internet connections in schools
(Singh et al., 2020). The same percentage of secondary
school teachers in Isfahan, Islamic Republic of Iran, lacked
easy access to software related to their subject. As well,
most software on the market is designed in English only
and is not adapted to the local culture, which affects
how effectively teachers can integrate technology,
particularly in literature and the humanities (Esfijani and
Zamani, 2020). Teachers with disabilities face higher
barriers. In Ethiopia for instance, the absence of assistive
technologies, such as screen readers or magnifiers,
e-books or word prediction programmes, prevents the full
engagement of visually impaired teachers; in fact, there
are teachers who may not even be aware of some assistive
technologies (Alala, 2022).
Teachers are also often left out of decisions to select new
digital technology: 45% of teachers from 94 countries
participating in Education International's Teaching with
Tech study reported that their unions had not been
consulted at all regarding the introduction of new digital
technologies, while 29% had been consulted on ‘only
a few aspects’. At the same time, 57% of respondents
indicated that their unions had not been consulted on
the digital technology they wanted (Colclough, 2020).
When schools and teachers are provided with equipment,
teachers should also be supported to use them effectively
(Zacarias, 2023): in the United States, schools often
purchase expensive software licences but do not invest in
teacher training programmes due to budgetary constraints
(Kologrivaya and Shleifer, 2022).

VARIOUS BARRIERS PREVENT TEACHERS
FROM MAKING THE MOST OF WHAT
TECHNOLOGY CAN OFFER

AGE CAN IMPACT TEACHERS’ TECHNOLOGY SKILLS
AND PRACTICES

Teachers face various obstacles when trying to integrate
these technology practices and resources into their
professional practice. Lack of access to infrastructure
is one of them. In 2018, teachers in schools with a lack
of digital infrastructure in Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries were
seven percentage points less likely to feel that they
could support student learning through the use of digital
technology ‘quite a bit’ or ‘a lot’ than their peers in better
equipped schools (OECD, 2022a) (Figure 9.1). More than
half of teachers reported in the T4 survey that inadequate
online access had hampered schools’ ability to provide
quality education. Two in five teachers said they needed to
bring their own digital devices to school to compensate for
the lack of classroom resources. Almost a third of teachers
reported their school only had one computer, laptop or
tablet for educational use (Pota et al., 2021).

It is generally assumed that older teachers possess fewer
skills and are less prepared to use technology in teaching.
According to the 2018 Teaching and Learning International
Survey (TALIS), older teachers in the 48 participating
education systems were more likely to have weaker skills
and lower self-efficacy in using ICT. This relationship holds
true even after accounting for characteristics such as years
of experience, contract type, teacher training in ICT use
and classroom composition (OECD, 2018). The European
Commission's SELFIE tool showed significant age-related
differences in the use of digital tools in teaching between
younger and older upper secondary technical and
vocational education and training (TVET) teachers (OECD,
2021a). In Indonesia, older teachers in Islamic religious
schools found it more difficult to keep up with the rapid
pace of ICT change, hampering their ability to use different
tools (Miskiah et al., 2019). In Sudan, a study of 200 TVET

teachers found that older teachers had lower ICT skills in
word processing, spreadsheets and databases (Ramadan
et al., 2018).
In practice, teachers often rely on their creativity to make
up for lack of skills. According to the T4 survey, during the
COVID-19 disruption, more experienced teachers deployed
more creative strategies than younger teachers, such as
integrating video and audio recordings in their teaching.
They were also more likely to be the first to adapt and
encourage change among their peers (Pota et al., 2021).
In India, as part of the Connected Learning Initiative,
the most experienced secondary school teachers placed

less emphasis on the challenges of technology integration
(Connected Learning Initiative, 2020). Background
research for this report conducted with 70 teachers from
17 countries showed that teacher resistance to technology
was related to preparation, not age. While novice and
younger teachers generally know how to use technology,
they often have difficulties in integrating it thoughtfully
into their teaching practice (Burns, 2023).
Along with age, gender is also sometimes believed to have
an impact on ICT skills, as there is the stereotype that
female teachers may be less comfortable using technology.
Some gender differences may appear in teacher confidence

9

in using ICT and in their attitudes towards the pedagogical
use of ICT, but these are generally neither significant
nor consistent across different contexts, at least in
upper-middle and high-income countries (Punter et al.,
2017).

Gender is also sometimes believed to have an
impact on ICT skills, as there is the stereotype
that female teachers may be less comfortable
using technology
SOME TEACHERS ARE HESITANT OR LACK
CONFIDENCE IN USING TECHNOLOGY
Many teachers recognize the importance of digital
technologies in education, regardless of their background,
age or skills. Analysis of TALIS and the Programme for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies data from
11 European countries showed a larger variation in teacher
technology skills than in their attitudes (Hämäläinen et al.,
2021). The REDS International Survey also indicated that
most teachers believed that new pedagogical approaches
integrating technology would remain in place after the
pandemic (Meinck et al., 2022).

virus attacks, leaks of student data and privacy problems
in online teaching (Joshi et al., 2020). In Indonesia, teachers
were concerned about using free public Wi-Fi, which
compromises data security (Purwanto et al., 2020).
Teachers may lack confidence in using technology to teach.
Only 43% of teachers in OECD countries felt well- or very
well-prepared for using technology for teaching after their
initial education or training (OECD, 2020). Teachers who
felt they could support student learning through the use of
digital technology ‘quite a bit’ or ‘a lot’ were more likely
to teach in private than in public schools (OECD, 2022b).
According to the 2018 TALIS, the more effective lower
secondary school teachers felt in their own use of ICT,
the more likely they were to let their students use
technology for projects or class work (OECD, 2018).
The 2018 ICILS found that 84% of teachers in the
13 participating education systems knew how to prepare
lessons that involved the use of ICT by students, while just
under 60% knew how to contribute to online discussions,
collaborate with others on platforms (such as wikis or
blogs) or through shared resources (such as Google Docs),
and use a learning management system (such as Moodle,
Blackboard or Edmodo) (Fraillon et al., 2020). A knowledge
gap with students may also lead teachers to limit their use
of ICT in teaching (Spiteri and Chang Rundgren, 2020).

However, some teachers are more critical of the use of
technology in the classroom. Among grade 8 teachers
surveyed in the 2018 International Computer and
Information Literacy Study (ICILS), 37% agreed that the
use of technology distracted students from learning
and 46% that it limited personal communication
between students (Fraillon et al., 2020). In Europe,
while three out of four lower secondary teachers who
took part in a self-assessment of their competencies in
technology-enhanced teaching believed that ICT enables
students to communicate more effectively with others,
develop a greater interest in learning and work at a level
that corresponds to their learning abilities, just over half
of them thought that ICT improves students’ academic
performance (Abbiati et al., 2023).

Lack of training is one significant reason that explains
this knowledge gap. The 2018 TALIS indicated that one in
five lower secondary school teachers in OECD countries
expressed a high need for professional development in ICT
skills for teaching, making it the second most important
area of training after support to learners with special
needs (OECD, 2019). This need was confirmed by grade
4 mathematics and science teachers in the 2019 Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study: only 35% and
32%, respectively, reported participating in professional
development in this area, the least common of all areas
inquired. About half of grade 8 mathematics and science
teachers received such training (Mullis et al., 2020). As part
of the European Commission’s SELFIE tool, less than half of
TVET teachers reported that head teachers had discussed
with them their professional development needs for
teaching with digital technologies (OECD, 2021a).

Even when they recognize its value overall, teachers may
consider the use of technology to be less suitable for
certain subjects or levels of education. In the Netherlands,
a study highlighted pre-service teachers’ doubts about the
use of technology in kindergartens, especially to promote
early literacy, as they felt that teaching young children
should be based on concrete, not virtual, experiences
(Voogt and McKenney, 2017). Negative attitudes may in
some cases be related to safety. In India, teachers reported

Access to training is not enough. First, training must be
continuously evaluated and responsive to teacher needs.
Analysis of countries’ policies, plans, strategies and
laws on teacher education, as reflected in the Profiles
Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER) profiles, shows
that key areas are sometimes overlooked: for example,
only 21% of countries mention online safety as part of
training in these documents. Second, training must be
sustainable, a difficult task given the rapid changes that

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

168

9

make programmes obsolete. Donor-funded projects
do not operate for more than 36 months on average
(von Lautz-Cauzanet, 2022). A review of 170 studies on
technology-based teacher professional development
programmes in low- and middle-income countries showed
that one fifth of them focus on time constraints as a
challenge to sustainability (Hennessy et al., 2023).

EDUCATION SYSTEMS ARE TAKING STEPS
TO HELP TEACHERS DEVELOP THEIR
CAPACITY
Education systems are responding to help teachers
develop professional competence in technology, first and
foremost by setting standards. They complement those
standards with instruments, such as self-assessment
tools (Box 9.1), and teacher training programmes. Since
the outbreak of COVID-19, these training efforts have
become more organized and structured. More generally,
many teacher capacity development programmes are
introducing digital elements, which can improve flexibility,
collaboration, coaching effectiveness, reflection and
subject knowledge. These efforts require multiple actors

to be engaged, including head teachers, school ICT
coordinators and teacher unions.
ICT STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS AIM TO DEFINE
DEVELOPMENT NEEDS
Governments and regional and international organizations
have been developing teacher standards and competency
frameworks to guide teacher development through
training and coaching. According to the GEM Report’s PEER
for 211 education systems, 51% have set ICT standards
for teachers in a competency framework, teacher training
framework, development plan or strategy (Figure 9.2).
European and Northern American countries have been
the most proactive. The introduction of ICT standards for
teachers began in Europe in the 1970s (Bucherberger et al.,
2000) and Latin America in the 2000s (Zacarias, 2023).
It is estimated that 19% of countries with ICT standards
have specified or readjusted the ICT skills expected of
teachers since 2020 to reflect changes brought about by
the COVID-19 disruption.

envisages the use of digital technologies across teacher
practices. The 2019 Digital Competency Framework is
complementary and conceives digital education as a
form of literacy and social practice for which teachers
are responsible (Quebec Ministry of Education, 2019).
To operationalize these two frameworks, the Ministry of
Education has been organizing annual digital education
days for teachers since 2019. It has also launched the
CompetenceNumerique.ca platform, which allows teachers
to develop their digital skills in engaging ways, including
through games (Quebec Government, 2020). Since 2021,
a digital pedagogy management and leadership training
programme, also offered by the Ministry of Education,
supports school administrators through school-level
digital action plans, to develop their skills to implement
measures identified in the frameworks and to improve
teacher competencies.
In Spain, the National Institute of Educational
Technologies and Teacher Training regulates the digital
competence of teachers through the Common Digital
Competence Framework for Teachers, adopted in 2017.
Building on this framework, the Institute offers a wide
range of face-to-face and online training courses and
collaborative school projects. It also promotes open
educational resources and other support materials for
teachers, including applications, platforms, networks
and communities of practice that facilitate the exchange
of experience and resources between teachers. These
initiatives are subject to an annual monitoring report,
which lists all the latest training resources published by
the Institute as well as the number of certified training
activities implemented and teachers trained (INTEF, 2021).
Organizations that have developed ICT frameworks for
teachers include the CARICOM Secretariat (Standards
for the Teaching Profession), the European Commission
(DigCompEdu), UNESCO (ICT Competency Framework
for Teachers, ICT-CFT) (Figure 9.3) and the World Bank
(Teachers’ Skills and Skills Frameworks for Remote and
Blended Learning Knowledge Pack). Non-governmental
organizations have also been active in developing
frameworks, including the International Society for
Technology in Education (National Educational Technology
Standards for Teachers, NETS-T), the Education and
Training Foundation (Digital Teaching Professional
Framework) and ProFuturo (Global Framework of
Competence for Education in the Digital Age – Teacher)
(Trujillo Sáez et al., 2020).

Some countries have adopted ICT teacher
competency frameworks developed by
researchers
the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)
(Mishra and Koehler, 2006; Miskiah et al., 2019), the DigiLit
Leicester framework (by the Leicester City Council in the
United Kingdom and De Montfort University Leicester)
and the Competency Profile for the Digital Teacher
(Ally, 2019). Background research for this report, which
compared DigCompEdu, UNESCO ICT-CFT, NETS-T, Digit
Leicester and TPACK, found that the two areas included in
all frameworks were professional development and subject
teaching and learning. Within these, assessment only
appeared twice. This analysis demonstrated the difficulty
of creating a set of shared indicators across all contexts
(Queen Rania Teacher Academy, 2023).

Self-assessment tools support teachers to
identify their development needs
Teachers want to know their strengths and weaknesses in
terms of technology applications, and what resources and
support they can access that will cater to their individual
needs (Burns, 2023). Ideally, measures of teacher skills should
be based on external observation, but such instruments are
complex and expensive (Tomczyk and Fedeli, 2021). Therefore,
these tools are mainly based on teachers’ self-assessments or
reported practices.
The Centre for Innovation in Brazilian Education (CIEB),
a non-profit association aiming to promote a culture of
innovation in public education, launched a digital skills
self-assessment tool for basic education teachers in 2019.
This instrument provides diagnosis in three areas: pedagogy,
such as practice, personalization, evaluation and creation;
digital citizenship, with a focus on responsible, critical and
safe use and inclusion; and professional development, with
a focus on self-development, self-evaluation, sharing and
communication skills. Guidelines for professional development
activities, including those offered by the CIEB, are also
proposed to ensure that training is tailored to the profile of
teachers (Centre for Innovation in Brazilian Education, 2022).
The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership
has developed a self-assessment tool for teachers to
evaluate their skills in using technology in teaching. This
research-based tool is aligned with national teacher standards.
After completing the self-assessment, teachers receive
feedback on their strengths and areas for improvement, which
can help them identify areas where they may need additional
professional development or training. A validation process
involved almost 6,000 teachers (AITSL, 2023).
In South-eastern Europe, the Digital Needs Analysis for
Teachers Tool, which is based on the European Commission’s
Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu),
has engaged teachers in Albania, Montenegro, Northern
Macedonia, the Republic of Moldova and Serbia to self-assess
their digital skills. The tool provides a representative picture of
teachers’ needs by country and by school type. Teachers also
reflected on how to integrate the tool into their professional
development. Its use has helped policymakers better
understand teacher needs, analyse training supply and reflect
on the role of data in policymaking, especially on teacher
education (European Training Foundation, 2022).

TRAINING EFFORTS HAVE BECOME MORE
SYSTEMATIC AFTER COVID-19
Analysis of PEER profiles shows that only one quarter
of education systems have legislation to ensure teacher
training in technology, through initial or in-service training.
Of these, some make such training mandatory in their
legislation, or even define it as a teacher right. In the
French-speaking community of Belgium, a 2020 decree
stipulates that initial teacher education must prepare
teachers to develop a digital culture and to use computer
science for educational, pedagogical and didactic purposes
(Parliament of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, 2020).
In Croatia, the 2020 Act on Education in Primary and
Secondary Schools affirms the right and obligation for
teachers to receive professional training in ICT through
programmes approved by the Ministry of Education
(Croatia Government, 2020). In Romania, the 2022 draft
Law on Pre-University Education states that initial
and in-service teacher training should focus on the
development of digital skills. In-service training should
help teachers acquire digital skills and teach with digital
tools, new technologies and open educational resources
(Romania Government, 2022).

Only one quarter of education systems have
legislation to ensure teacher training in
technology
In Chile, the 2016 law on the teacher professional
development system mandates teacher pedagogical
standards based on the 2003 Good Teaching Framework,
which identifies teaching strategies to integrate digital
technologies and ensure their safe, ethical and legal use
(Chile Government, 2016). In Rwanda, a 2020 Presidential
Order, which establishes special teacher governing
statutes from pre-primary to vocational education,
stipulates that teachers have the right and the duty to take
part in capacity-development programmes to improve
their expertise and knowledge, including the integration of
ICT in teaching and learning.
Globally, 72% of education systems have a policy, plan or
strategy for pre-service teacher education in technology,
while 84% have one for in-service teacher professional
development (Figure 9.4).

According to the 2018 TALIS, 56% of lower secondary
school teachers in the 48 participating education systems
had received training in the use of ICT as part of their
formal education or training, ranging from 37% in Sweden
to 97% in Viet Nam (OECD, 2020). Meanwhile, 60% of
teachers had received training in the use of ICT as part
of their in-service training in the 12 months prior to the
survey, ranging from 40% in Belgium to 93% in Viet Nam
(OECD, 2021b). Apart from Viet Nam, more than three
quarters of teachers had received in-service ICT training
in Chile, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Singapore, the United Arab
Emirates and Shanghai (China) (OECD, 2022a) (Figure 9.5).
In the European Union, less than half of teachers reported
that ICT was included in their initial education or training
before the pandemic (European Commission, 2020).
School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
ensuing switch to online learning for many education

systems, accelerated efforts to prepare teachers for using
ICT. In 2021, 89% of countries reported having provided
training on online course delivery through distance
learning, the most common teacher support measure,
ahead of pedagogical content adapted to distance learning
(80%), professional, psychosocial and emotional support
(78%) and free connectivity (59%) (UNESCO et al., 2021).
By 2022, more than 80% of low- and middle-income
countries reported having implemented professional
development activities for teachers in digital skills from
primary to upper secondary education. The share of
countries that had implemented such activities among
pre-primary teachers, although lower than for other
education levels, rose from 48% in 2020/21 to 62% in
2021/22 (UNESCO et al., 2022). The sample report of
the REDS International survey found that most schools
in upper-middle- and high-income countries reported
having increased teacher professional development on
distance education. But fewer schools did so in low-income
countries, ranging from 4% in Burkina Faso to 50% in
Rwanda (Meinck et al., 2022) (Figure 9.6).
In Indonesia, 44% of primary and lower secondary teachers
surveyed by the World Bank had received online training
during the pandemic, three quarters of whom had never
participated in online training before (Yarrow et al., 2022).
According to the T4 education survey, 42% of teachers
worldwide spent more than 10 days on professional
development in 2020, above the OECD average of
62 hours per year (Pota et al., 2021). About 80% of
countries worldwide have reported plans to maintain
or expand in-service training in digital skills for primary
and secondary teachers, while around 70% of countries
reported such plans for initial training as well
(UNESCO et al., 2022).
Other ICT-related areas of training may be needed.
For example, countries are recognizing the prevalence
of electronic cheating in student assessments.
Montenegro enacted a law on academic integrity in
2019, while in Ukraine, the 2017 education law provides
a clear list of expectations regarding academic integrity
(Ukraine Government, 2017). However, it is important
to accompany legislation with training in identifying and
addressing electronic cheating. A review of available
tools suggests that teachers need to exercise critical
judgement in using plagiarism detection software, making
comparisons and analysing the number of similarities
reported, as these programmes do not unambiguously
identify cases of plagiarism. Teachers also need to be
trained not to violate non-disclosure agreements by
uploading students’ work to text-matching software
(Foltýnek et al., 2020).

TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING TEACHER TRAINING
In addition to training teachers to use technology, the use
of technology as a means of teacher training is also
increasing in countries, transforming the way teachers can
learn. A synthesis of 170 studies for this report showed
that the use of technology can make a major contribution
to teacher professional development in low- and
middle-income countries (Hennessy et al., 2023).
…creating flexible learning environments
Technology can be a tool to make training opportunities
more accessible, helping overcome location and time
barriers. Such flexibility also helps teachers choose the
pace, location and modality of their learning and, in some
cases, even the content and pedagogical approach.

Distance learning, including massive open online courses
(MOOCs), and self-study models improve teacher
self-efficacy in remote and rural areas, as well as in
emergency settings (INEE, 2021). The Distance Learning
and Teacher Training Strategies in the Caribbean Small
Island Development States project was piloted in 2020 and
scaled up in 2021. It is a four-week hybrid training that
addressed concerns related to the pandemic, such as
engaging and interacting for learning online, converting
content into appropriate online learning formats, handling
school management issues, and working with students
with diverse educational needs (Conover, 2022b; UNESCO,
2020). Participating teachers appreciated the use of
self-study reading materials that offered opportunities for
further self-reflection (Teacher Task Force and UNESCO,
2022). Distance education programmes have been found

Whether training is about or through technology, teachers
value hands-on, personalized and collaborative training.
They want to use technology tools, experiment with
different software and devices, and learn about the
practical applications of technology in classrooms and
its benefits for students. While teachers report that the
use of technology in pre-service programmes is often too
theoretical (Burns, 2021), they can use technology to learn
from each other, share best practices and work together on
projects (Burns, 2023).

to promote teacher learning in mathematics in South
Africa (Amevor et al., 2021) and even to equal the impact
of in-person training in Ghana (Henaku and Pobbi, 2017).
But as with other MOOCs, more privileged learners access
them (Castillo et al., 2015) and the materials are often
developed outside the specific context of the learner.
Blended learning models, involving classroom applications
coupled with virtual peer reflection, have also shown
to improve teaching practices, for instance in India
(Wolfenden et al., 2017). In Kenya, the JiFUNzeni approach
encouraged rural teachers to use solar-powered tablets
and open source educational resources and software
to collaborate in creating context-relevant multimedia
learning resources. Teachers were trained to use the
tablets and could reach their trainers at any time via mobile
phones. Bimonthly face-to-face follow-up meetings
provided spaces for teachers to share their experience of
using the resources developed in the classroom. Trainers
created new ways to support teachers through blended
approaches and teachers were still using the strategies
they developed a year after the intervention
(Onguko, 2014).

Virtual communities of practice are one promising model
for peer learning and resource sharing, especially in
the absence of face-to-face communication or subject
specialists. In the Flemish Community of Belgium,
the KlasCement network, created in 1998, was designed
as a ‘community for and by teachers’. It expanded access to
digital educational content during the COVID-19 pandemic
and provided teachers with a space to discuss best
practices for implementing distance education. At the start
of the pandemic, more than 22,000 teachers joined this
platform, with 500 learning resources shared and more
than 50 discussions initiated weekly. This bottom-up
initiative was initially conceived and managed by a
non-profit organization but is now coordinated by the
Ministry of Education (Minea-Pic, 2022).
Virtual communities have emerged, primarily through
social networks, for communication (via social networks
like WhatsApp) and resource sharing (via video
conferencing software like Zoom). About 80% of more
than 1,500 teachers surveyed in the Caribbean belong to
professional WhatsApp groups and 44% use such instant
messaging to collaborate at least once a week. In the
United Republic of Tanzania, active teacher collaboration
in Telegram-supported teacher groups emerged before
the pandemic but strengthened during school closures,
as membership expanded to 17,000 teachers. This
virtual support mechanism reinforced in-person teacher
collaboration and is embedded in teachers’ lives (von
Lautz-Cauzanet and Buchstab, 2023). A review of
practitioners in emergency settings found that virtual
communities of practice were seen as a form of continuous
professional development: more than half believed their
participation had fostered a sense of community and
improved their confidence and well-being
(El-Serafy et al., 2023).

In Botswana, 71% of all TVET teachers in the country were
trained with the Future Teacher Kit, a tool developed by the
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
(GIZ) and UNESCO. In collaboration with the Botswana
Ministry of Education and Skills Development,
the programme trained teachers individually via WhatsApp,
as well as interactive voice response accompanied by
Messenger groups, to exchange information on the training
content. All TVET institutions had a focal point to help
teachers progress through the training. One outcome is
that teachers set up learning circles to continue engaging
with each other on the content. It is envisaged that the
approach will extend to secondary school teachers (von
Lautz-Cauzanet and Buchstab, 2023).
…supporting coaching and mentoring
Experienced teachers play a key role in professional
development as coaches and mentors. Technology
can facilitate their involvement in providing feedback,
observing classes and encouraging younger teachers
to follow certain practices. As part of the Estonian
mentoring programme, for instance, online mentor
seminars, held two to three times a year for those trained
in mentorship, management, or intern supervision, also
provide counselling and discussions for future plans
(Burns, 2023). Coaching software has been used to provide
structured observation tools to improve the quality of
support. The Tangerine:Coach software provided guided
observation protocols to coaches in Kenya and Uganda,
automatically generating feedback that coaches can share
with teachers. Tablets and software simplified coaches’
work and increased their commitment to improve their
work (Pouezevara et al., 2019).
Conversely, technology can help teachers access a wider
range of expertise and experience than they might find
locally. The Inspiring Teachers’ Peer Coaching Platform
connects volunteer teachers based in the United
Kingdom and the United States with teachers in low- and
middle-income countries. Workshops are held to share
teaching techniques, while practice sessions provide an
opportunity for teachers to apply them while facilitating
peer observation and feedback. Inspiring Teachers partners
with local organizations across 11 countries, reaching
more than 5,000 teachers in South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa (Inspiring Teachers, 2022). In Kenya, the Teachers
for Teachers initiative in Kakuma refugee camp is led by
Teachers College Columbia University. The initiative uses
real-time reporting through text messages and email,
classroom observations and summaries to organize
training and mentoring for teachers. For two to six months,
teachers are matched with an experienced global mentor
who provides ongoing support (Teachers College, 2022).

175

C H A P T E R 9 • T eachers

Virtual coaching appears to have the same impact on
teachers as in-person coaching (Evans, 2021). In the
United States, online coaching of teachers has produced
similar results to face-to-face coaching (Kraft et al., 2018).
In South Africa, face-to-face coaching appears to be
equally effective in the short term, although it produces
better results in the long term (Kotze et al., 2019), which
suggests virtual coaching needs to overcome the challenge
of maintaining trusting relationships over time
(Cilliers et al., 2022).
Yet virtual coaching often has huge cost advantages.
In Senegal, the Reading for All programme reached
more than 14,000 teachers in 2020/21 using an ongoing
professional development model that included in-person
workshops and in-person and online coaching. Teachers
receiving any type of coaching were 23% more likely to give
constructive feedback, and students had better learning
outcomes in reading when their teachers were being
coached. While face-to-face coaching improved teaching
practices and was considered more useful by teachers,
online coaching was still 83% less costly than face-to-face
coaching, although it still achieved a small but significant
improvement in the way teachers guided their students’
reading practice (Bagby et al., 2022; Hennessy et al., 2023).
…increasing reflective practice
Critical self-reflection helps teachers analyse the impact
of, and ultimately improve, their instructional strategies.
Some technology resources can develop teachers’
reflective practices, especially videos but also digital
storytelling, e-portfolios and blogging. Videos allow
teachers to observe exemplary teachers, to whom they
often lack access, or to watch themselves or their
peers teach.
The OER4Schools programme in Zambia has integrated
video lessons into a multimodal and blended approach
to support teachers with an emphasis on inclusion.
Learning was guided by built-in prompts for both
teachers and facilitators, while materials linked theory
to practice. Teachers were able to work together to try
new pedagogical strategies. A professional learning
resource was developed, consisting of 25 two-hour
sessions organized into five units and covering interactive
teaching principles, group work, questioning, dialogue,
formative assessment and inquiry-based student learning.
An evaluation found that teachers who completed the
sessions became more responsive to disadvantaged
students’ needs (Hennessy et al., 2015;
Hennessy et al., 2016).

9

…improving teacher subject and pedagogical knowledge
Technology can be put to service for teachers who need to
improve their knowledge of the language of instruction or
a second language they teach. Multilingual skills are critical
for teachers working in contexts where the language of
instruction is not their first language (EdTech Hub, 2022).
Improving subject and pedagogical knowledge is
particularly important for teachers from remote areas
who may have more limited access to quality training
opportunities. Technology support includes specialist
language learning applications, audiovisual materials,
lesson plans on preloaded devices, virtual coaching and
other tools.
In South Africa, under an intervention of the non-profit
organization Funda Wande, teachers received a preloaded
USB stick containing lesson plans, classroom videos and
teaching materials. This initiative has increased literacy in
isiXhosa, led to changes in teacher pedagogical practices
and had a significant impact on the reading proficiency of
all learners regardless of their initial skill level, in particular
grade 1 students (Ardington and Meiring, 2020).
Software applications are commonly used to improve
teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge, especially
in mathematics and science. For instance, used with
certain pedagogies and support structures, Geogebra,
an interactive application for teaching mathematics,
has improved teacher and teacher educator understanding
of a range of mathematical concepts (Golding and Batiibwe,
2020). But as with much of this research, studies that
control for other determinants of learning are rare and
the positive impact may therefore not extend to changing
teacher practices.
MANY ACTORS SUPPORT TEACHER PROFESSIONAL
DEVELOPMENT IN ICT
With such a broad scope of teacher professional
development opportunities in ICT, the ongoing support
of several stakeholders is needed (Burns, 2023). This
includes head teachers, ICT coordinators, universities,
unions, non-governmental organizations and multilateral
organizations.
Head teachers play a key role in setting the conditions
for the integration of technology in schools. First, they
support digital implementation following the expectations
set in national plans. In Singapore, the Educational
Technology Plan 2020–30 calls on head teachers to
adopt a data-driven and learner-centred approach and to
develop an environment that supports lifelong learning by
integrating ICT at school and at home (Singapore Ministry
of Education, 2022). In South Africa, the 2018 Professional

Head teachers play a key role in setting the
conditions for the integration of technology
in schools
Development Framework for Digital Learning requires
head teachers to empower the school team in planning
and implementing digital learning and to initiate
collaborative teacher learning (South Africa Department
of Basic Education, 2018). Second, head teachers manage
the digital infrastructure. Depending on their degree
of autonomy, they may be responsible for purchasing,
maintaining and renewing equipment licences. Third,
they can create a culture of sharing and experimentation,
for example supporting teachers, promoting good practice
in the use of digital technology, and recognizing the time
spent on digital integration (Gravelle et al., 2020;
Gravelle et al., 2021).
In practice, the level of support which head teachers
provide is hard to gauge and varies widely. According
to the 2018 ICILS, prior to the pandemic, less than
25% of students attended schools whose head teachers
considered it a priority to give teachers time to prepare
lessons in which ICT is used, and some 40% of students
attended schools whose head teachers considered it a
priority to encourage teachers to integrate the use of
ICT into their teaching. Head teachers’ expectations of
teachers in relation to the integration of ICT also vary
widely. Almost 45% of students who participated in the
2018 ICILS were in schools whose head teachers expected
teachers to communicate with parents through ICT and
31% were in schools with a head teacher who expected
teachers to communicate with their students through ICT
(Figure 9.7) (Fraillon et al., 2020).
A sense of urgency appears to have grown during the
pandemic, at least in countries that relied on digital
learning. According to the European Commission’s
SELFIE tool, just over half of upper secondary TVET
teachers received support from their school leaders to
try out new ways of teaching with digital technologies
and to share their experiences with their colleagues
during the COVID-19 pandemic (OECD, 2021a). In Malta,
a study of the transition to distance education during the
COVID-19 disruption showed that head teachers were
available and supportive, encouraging staff to work and
learn as a team and to communicate with each other.
Teachers in schools that received such support from
their head teacher were able to build collegiality and
effectiveness (Busuttil and Farrugia, 2020).

ICT coordinators provide technical support and
professional development, although the scope of
their functions varies greatly between schools
(León-Jariego et al., 2020). In Spain, ICT coordinators act
as internal advisers to facilitate change and as mediators
between ICT policy requirements and the school. They
help teachers solve problems related to ICT use and
encourage the pedagogical use of ICT by teachers and
students. A survey of more than 5,000 teachers showed
that 77% received support to develop ICT teaching,
58% benefited from ICT training in school and 43%
had experienced ICT innovation projects, all organized
by ICT coordinators (Moreira et al., 2019). In the
United Kingdom, ICT support technicians are responsible
for school networks, installing, monitoring and maintaining
software and hardware, and providing technical support
and professional development to teachers and students.
They are also involved in the handling of confidential
information, such as health data on teachers and
students and confidential information from or for senior
management, including budget plans. In addition, they
protect the school by maintaining internet filtering
(UNISON, 2022).

Some countries set criteria for the selection and
professional development of ICT coordinators. In Israel,
the Ministry of Education requires them to be teachers
with at least four years’ teaching experience, to have
attended professional development courses in the field of
ICT over the past five years, to have a thorough knowledge
of the processes of teaching, learning and assessment in
an online environment, and to be familiar with the entire
curriculum. Furthermore, ICT coordinators are required
to follow a 60-hour training programme covering the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework
and change leadership (Avidov-Ungar and
Hanin-Itzak, 2019).
Universities, teacher training institutions and research
institutes offer specialized training, encourage research
and innovation, and partner with schools to support
teacher professional development in ICT. In Rwanda,
the 2016 ICT in Education Policy envisaged collaboration
between universities and teacher training schools to make
teaching practices learner-centred. One such collaboration,
between the University of Rwanda, teachers and the
government, resulted in the development of an ICT course
for teachers (Moore et al., 2018).

Teacher unions focus on protecting teachers’ rights with
regards to technology, advocating for policies that support
teachers who face challenges related to technology use.
In 2020, the Confederation of Education Workers of the
Argentine Republic reached a collective agreement with
the government in response to the work overload created
by school closures. The agreement established education
workers’ right to disconnect and required the Ministry
of Education to invest in the provision of technological
resources for distance learning (Education International,
2022). In Peru in May 2020, the Ministry of Education
issued additional accountability requirements, requiring
teachers to submit monthly reports with evidence of
their online and distance work. This was questioned
by the National Union of Teachers of Peru, leading
the government to adjust its guidelines to reduce the
administrative workload of teachers (Munoz-Najar, 2022).
Civil society organizations often fill gaps in government
provision, in poor and rich countries alike. In Chad, Kenya,
Lebanon and Niger, the Carey Institute for Global Good,
a non-profit organization, supports refugee teachers in
creating open educational resources and online courses
(Carey Institute for Global Good, 2021). The Estonian
Information Technology Foundation for Education
established an information line to answer teachers’
technology questions during the COVID-19 pandemic
(Barron at al., 2021). In Sierra Leone, Plan International
implemented the Girls' Access to Education project
between 2013 and 2021, funded by the United Kingdom.
The project supported more than 700 young women from
rural communities to become primary school teachers
through a distance education programme, while also
supporting them on days requiring face-to-face training
(Saidu et al., 2021). In Ukraine, the Academic Integrity and
Quality Initiative offers a free online course for teachers,
on academic integrity in assessment and methodological
advice on avoiding plagiarism (EdEra, 2022).
Multilateral organizations provide resources, support
research, facilitate collaboration and networking, advocate
for policies and funding, and provide technical assistance
for teacher professional development in ICT. The World
Bank’s Technology for Teaching programme has developed
guides for the implementation of technology-based
teacher education programmes directed at policymakers
and practitioners (World Bank, 2022a, 2022b). UNESCO
has produced a learner-centred taxonomy for teachers
to assess the functionality of online platforms with
respect to curriculum support, data management, online
collaboration between teachers and learners, online
teaching, and formative assessment to identify gaps and

plan educational strategies (UNESCO, 2020a). The UNESCO
Institute for Information Technologies in Education
develops country-specific materials for trainers to support
the integration of ICT into pedagogy, with a particular focus
on higher education and TVET (IITE, 2023).

CONCLUSION
Technology is slowly but surely changing the teaching
profession. In those education systems where technology
is widely available, teachers need to adapt their pedagogy,
use multiple resources related to the curriculum and
assessment, and interact more frequently with students
and parents. COVID-19 accelerated this transformation.
Yet, many teachers still lack access to appropriate
technology and the necessary infrastructure. Moreover,
they have varying attitudes towards the usefulness
of technology and varying beliefs about their ability to
integrate technology to improve student achievement.
Many teachers receive sufficient, appropriate and
sustainable teacher professional development. But their
participation in decisions that affect them in the planning,
implementation, regulation and evaluation of technology
in education is generally lacking. Many education systems
develop competence frameworks and complementary
tools to guide their investments in teacher professional
development. The supportive work of many actors who
can complement government efforts is a precondition for
success in this area.
Working with a wide range of educational practitioners,
including teachers, is key to developing education
technology policies. Involving teachers and reflecting their
experiences at an early stage of policy development will
increase teachers’ acceptance of technologies and will help
make these policies more effective. Ongoing, school-based
teacher professional development is critical to build their
skills and confidence in using digital technologies. Ideally,
such programmes should provide hands-on experience and
opportunities for teachers to share experiences and best
practices with peers.

KE Y MESSAGES
Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills are the bedrock of future technology development,
but opportunities are unequally distributed.
Technology features in most secondary education programmes in the world.


Learning about technology can vary in nature and the topics it covers. In Eastern Europe and in Eastern and
South-eastern Asia, technology tends to be taught as a specialist, compulsory subject.



But many education systems have integrated technology across disciplines and also promote it through
workshops, projects and other extracurricular approaches.

STEM quality determines student aspirations and achievement.


A group of upper-middle- and high-income countries allocated 26% of grade 8 instructional time to science and
mathematics but increasing that time had no impact on learning. The 2019 Trends in International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMSS) showed that grade 8 students who had access to science laboratories in schools tended
to perform better.



A combination of teacher-directed and inquiry-based approaches led to higher achievement in science. Grade 8
students who reported that instruction was clear also performed better in mathematics and science.

Gender and social identities shape STEM aspirations.


Women in STEM accounted for just one third of global tertiary graduates in 2016–18. Gender is one of the
strongest determinants of the likelihood of pursuing education and careers in STEM. Grade 8 boys were more
willing to pursue a mathematics-related occupation than their female schoolmates in 87% of the education
systems participating in the 2019 TIMSS.



Early STEM learning may prevent negative beliefs about mathematics and science from building up. In Colombia,
the Pequeñas Aventureras project promotes STEM interest in pre-schools.

Higher education institutions are key to national technological development.

181



Higher education institutions support national technological development by preparing researchers through
teaching and learning, and by generating knowledge through their own or collaborative research. This role is
mediated through their engagement with governments, businesses and society, and their organization and
management.



The most innovative economies tend to have high scores in the university–industry collaboration indicator.
Businesses and universities in Israel, Switzerland and the United States exhibited the highest degree of
collaboration.



Performance-based funding to universities aims to stimulate competition, but competitive funding also has
downsides. In Japan, it reduced the originality of filed patents.



Enterprises contribute about 60% of research expenditure, but there are risks that such funding may influence the
choice of experimental design, framing questions and analyses, leading to bias.



Countries compete to attract students into STEM fields through scholarships. Since 2006, STEM education has
accounted for almost 30% of global scholarship recipients.

his report focuses on the impact that technology has
on education. Yet, the reverse also merits investigation:
the impact that education has on technology. How does
education impact the process of developing, transferring
and adopting technology, especially as related to science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
disciplines? While the past and future impact of technology
on education is still being debated, there is no doubt that
there is no technological development without the
sharing of knowledge over generations, the individual
pursuit of advanced education opportunities, and
organized research in higher education institutions
leading to technological innovation.
This chapter presents selected aspects of education’s
contribution to technology. First, the chapter examines
the provision of STEM education in secondary school
curricula. In particular, it looks at how it is delivered and
whether it is associated with students’ interests and
eventual outcomes, reflecting on opportunities to
promote equity in STEM aspiration and choices. Second,
it looks at how post-secondary education institutions
contribute to technological development through teaching
and research, evolving their strategies to remain relevant
and well resourced.

TECHNOLOGY FEATURES IN MOST
SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAMMES
Learning about technology has been gradually
introduced into general school curricula (de Vries, 2018b),
and is being taught in most educational systems in the
world (Keirl, 2018). However, there is great variation across
countries in what methods are used to teach technology,
and how important its role is. Technology education can
be taught as a stand-alone subject, or integrated across
disciplines (Keirl, 2015, 2018). It can be compulsory or
elective, and be taught in various grades.

TECHNOLOGY CAN BE TAUGHT AS
A STAND-ALONE SUBJECT
As a stand-alone subject, technology has been
conceived as skills and craft education, industrial
arts, or as vocational training. Its content remains
highly contextualized, responding to various national
strategies and cultural contexts (Buntting and Jones,
2015; de Vries, 2018b).
In some cases, teaching technology covers design thinking,
generally conceived as a problem-solving approach that
focuses on collaboration between designers and users.
For example, Botswana’s senior secondary curriculum
includes a design and technology subject whose content
ranges from health and safety to design tools and
processes. It was reformed in the early 2000s to also
include graphics, information technology and electronics
(Ruele, 2019). In the United Kingdom, the 2013 National
Curriculum for England introduced design and technology
studies targeting 5- to 14-year-olds. The subject drew
on mathematics, science, engineering, computing and
art, and even included a module on cooking and nutrition
(McLain et al., 2019; Department for Education, 2013).
Technology education can be closely tied to vocational
studies. In Scandinavia, the acquisition of skills to use
manual tools and machines has historically found its
expression in slöjd (craft) education (de Vries, 2018b).
Technology education was eventually added to the general
education track, despite maintaining a strong vocational
orientation. Sweden’s 2011 compulsory curriculum
emphasizes the handcraft nature of technology education
as a form of design and cultural expression (Hallström,
2018).

Globally, with the growing relevance of digital
technology, computer science education has
been introduced as a specialist subject in many
compulsory education curricula

The subject also varies in whether it is compulsory or
optional. Globally, with the growing relevance of digital
technology, computer science education has been
introduced as a specialist subject in many compulsory
education curricula (Chapter 5). Eastern European and
Eastern and South-eastern Asian countries tend to require
all students to follow a specialist technology subject
such as computer science education (Vegas et al., 2021).
All primary and secondary school students in Poland
have been taking informatics as a compulsory subject
since 2015 (Webb et al., 2017). In the same year,
the Republic of Korea also made informatics a compulsory
course in lower secondary school to provide all students
with a basic understanding of computational thinking
(Fraillon et al., 2020). In Viet Nam, the 2018 reform of
the national curriculum introduced information and
communication technology (ICT) as a compulsory
subject for grade 3 to 9 students, who are taught
foundations of digital technology and computer science
(Le Anh et al., 2023).
In Germany, technology education and foreign languages
are alternative options in Realschule, a type of lower
secondary school which typically leads to vocational
education. Since having a command of another language
is a requirement to access upper secondary education,
languages are preferred over technology by students who
want to pursue higher education. Technology education
tends to be selected by those who intend to pursue a
vocational track (Mammes et al., 2016).
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE INTEGRATED
ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND TAUGHT OUTISDE
THE CURRICULUM
Technology studies are sometimes integrated into the
disciplines of science, engineering and mathematics
(Buntting and Jones, 2015; Keirl, 2018). The United States
followed an interdisciplinary approach towards technology
education. Drawing on the tradition of industrial arts,
the study of technology was universalized through
the Technology for All Americans project, which was

183

sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the
1990s, and informed the development of comprehensive
standards for student technological literacy, assessments
and teacher professional development (Reed, 2018).
An integrated approach to STEM studies is now endorsed
by many education systems (Freeman et al., 2019;
Teo et al., 2021). Malaysia has a STEM framework that
covers all levels, from pre-primary to tertiary and adult
education. A project- and inquiry-based approach
informed the revised school curriculum, and advocacy
campaigns were organized to encourage youth to enter
STEM studies in tertiary education (Chong, 2019;
Malaysia Ministry of Education, 2013).
However, the interdisciplinary nature of STEM may
challenge pedagogies based on single disciplines.
Mathematics and science are usually taught as separate
subjects at primary and secondary level; technology
is traditionally a priority in vocational education; and
engineering is largely provided in higher education
(Holmlund et al., 2018). An analysis of Australia, England
(United Kingdom), Estonia, Hong Kong (China), South Africa,
Türkiye and the United States introducing engineering
into primary and secondary science standards shows
differences in how disciplines are understood and
taught. The United States, and to some extent Türkiye,
explicitly include engineering through primary and
secondary education science standards (Ekiz-Kiran and
Aydin-Gunbatar, 2021).
In addition to including STEM subjects in the curriculum,
they can also be promoted through workshops, projects
and other extracurricular approaches. Activities outside
school provide more contextual and flexible learning
experiences than those defined by the curriculum. Visions
of Science Network for Learning, a non-profit organization,
organizes weekly community science clubs in the
Greater Toronto Area, Canada, offering experiential
learning to 8- to 14-year-olds through workshops,
field excursions and real-world applications
(Duodu et al., 2017). The South Dakota State University’s
Civil and Environmental Engineering Department
promotes culturally responsive activities to attract Native
American girls to their study programmes. The project
combines indigenous arts and crafts with STEM content.
Results show that role models and a clearer link with the
community’s traditions led to a positive association with
STEM studies (Kant et al., 2018).

10

INSTRUCTION TIME IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS
Countries differ in the emphasis they place on STEM
subjects. The 2019 Trends in International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMSS) showed that participating
education systems, mostly from upper-middle-income and
high-income countries, allocated an average of 26% of total
grade 8 instructional time to science and mathematics.
The number of hours for mathematics ranged from 102 in
Cyprus to 200 in Chile, while science, when taught as a
separate subject, ranged from 73 hours in Italy to 243 in
Lebanon. Time allocation varies across education levels.
With grade advancement, time tends to decrease in
mathematics and increase in science (Mullis et al., 2020a).
Mathematics can be considered particularly difficult.
In France, 40% of grade 11 students abandoned
mathematics while transitioning to grade 12, following a
2018 reform that allowed them to choose specialization
subjects (France Ministry of National Education and Youth,
2021; Lecherbonnier, 2022; Morin, 2020). The government
reintroduced 1.5 hours of mathematics per week for all
students without mathematics as a core subject in grade
11, concerned that inequality in achievement would be
exacerbated without mathematics instruction (France
Ministry of National Education and Youth, 2022).
In principle, more instructional time dedicated to
mathematics and science should lead to more knowledge
and a better understanding of STEM fields. However,
in practice, the relationship between time invested and
learning achievement is not clear. Among education
systems that took part in the 2018 Programme for
International Student Assessment (PISA), 15-year-olds
in Finland, who are taught science for about 2 hours and
45 minutes per week, reported similar scores as their
peers in Canada, who are taught for more than twice that
time. Among countries of the Organisation for Economic

For more instruction time to lead to better results, it is
critical that time be used efficiently and concepts taught
effectively (Lopez-Agudo and Marcenaro-Gutierrez,
2022). Poor mathematics and science results in the
Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA) led Portugal to allocate more teaching hours to
Portuguese, mathematics and science as well as to
increase school autonomy and strengthen initial teacher
training. Implemented since 2013/14, these reforms have
been associated with improved student performance in the
two more recent PISA rounds (Maróco, 2021).

Countries strive to expand and improve school curricula to
attract more students to STEM subjects and provide them
with relevant knowledge and understanding. However,
low aspirations to STEM studies and careers do not
only reflect a genuine lack of interest in those subjects
(Archer et al., 2020). Aspirations can be shaped by prior
academic achievement, gender and social identities,
and socioeconomic inequalities, which often intersect
(Holmes et al., 2018).

Co-operation and Development (OECD), Chilean students
received the most instruction time in science, but perform
below the OECD average. Most of the top performing
education systems in mathematics tend to offer fewer
than four hours per week (OECD, 2020a).

A combination of teacher-directed and inquiry-based
approaches in science practices lead to higher science
achievement (Mourshed et al., 2017). According to the
2019 TIMSS, grade 8 students in schools with science
laboratories tend to perform better than their peers in
schools without them (Figure 10.1). One of the largest
gaps in science performance is observed in South Africa,
where more than half of students are in schools without
laboratories (Mullis et al., 2020a). Adequate laboratories
have high costs for their establishment and maintenance
that many countries cannot bear (Ofori Antipem, 2019).

TEACHER PREPARATION AND PRACTICE AFFECT
STEM ACHIEVEMENT AND ATTITUDES
Introducing technology into the curriculum should
be accompanied by adequate teacher training and
professional practice. Recruiting and retaining qualified
teachers in technology-related subjects remains
challenging. In New Zealand, technology is one of the
disciplines with the largest shortage of qualified teachers
(Reinsfield and Lee, 2021). To attract more students,
the University of Waikato reconceptualized pre-service
training for secondary technology teaching and also

The teaching experience of science professionals may
be relevant, as the ability to teach complex content with
clarity and the use of appropriate instructional materials
and pedagogical approaches impacts student performance
(Taylor et al., 2020). In the 2019 TIMSS, when asked how
easy it was to understand teachers, and whether teachers
were available to explain and support their learning, less
than half of grade 8 students evaluated the instructional
clarity of their mathematics and science classes as highly
satisfactory. Those most satisfied with instructional clarity
performed better than students reporting moderate or
low instructional clarity in both mathematics and science
(Mullis et al., 2020a) (Figure 10.2).

(OECD, 2018c). Teacher shortages lead countries to
consider employing personnel with qualifications and
preparation not specifically related to STEM
(UNESCO, 2021a), and out-of-field teaching is a worldwide
practice. In at least 40 countries, over 10% of lower
secondary science teachers did not receive any formal
education or training in the subject (OECD, 2018e).
In 27 education systems, an average of nearly half of
grade 8 students were taught mathematics by teachers
without a major in the subject (Mullis et al., 2020b).

extended admission to students with a vocational
background. In 2021, applications increased compared
with previous years (Reinsfield and Lee, 2022).
Education systems in high-income countries report
qualified teacher shortages in STEM disciplines
(European Union, 2018; Sims and Jerrim, 2020).
There is often a high demand for professionals with such
expertise in other sectors, which offer better remuneration
packages and working conditions than teaching

Another study using 2015 TIMSS data assessed the impact
of subject-specific teacher qualifications on student
achievement using the variation in student test scores
across four science subjects (biology, chemistry, physics
and earth science). Teachers having subject-specific
qualifications was associated with a positive impact
on test scores, and was even higher for disadvantaged
students and female students, in the latter case
compounded if the teacher was female. It was found that
a fifth of the effect was the result of teacher confidence
(Sancassani, 2023).
Out-of-field teaching may influence student engagement
and disposition. In Australia, where one in three secondary
mathematics classes are delivered by non-specialist
teachers, there has been a negative impact on student
choices to engage in post-secondary STEM studies.
Enrolments in advanced mathematics courses have
steadily worsened with the ongoing employment of
non-specialists (Prince and O'Connor, 2018). In the
United States, an evaluation of projects funded by the
National Science Foundation’s Discovery Research

B OX 10.1:

Career counselling and guidance can raise student STEM aspirations
Providing young people with relevant information about education and job opportunities can help challenge existing career stereotypes.
Research on the impact of career counselling has found that receiving guidance is also associated with positive academic achievement
(Hughes et al., 2016).
Some countries have made considerable efforts to raise STEM career awareness. Since 2019, Canada has invested about USD 11 million
to support the activities of the non-profit Let’s Talk Science, which promotes STEM educational and occupational opportunities to
teachers and students up to grade 12 through STEM career profiles and models (Let's Talk Science, 2022). In Kenya, Safaricom, a
telecommunications company, launched a digital mentorship programme for secondary school students in partnership with UNESCO and
the Eneza Foundation. Students receive information on STEM studies and career pathways from mentors and role models through local
television and radio channels, and text messages (Safaricom, 2020).
Counselling and guidance services expose youth to pathways they would have not otherwise considered (Musset and Kureková, 2018).
Role models and mentors have proved to increase girls’ confidence in STEM and to influence their career aspirations (Hencke et al., 2022).
Since 1995, Botswana has encouraged young women to pursue a career in science and technology fields through a job-shadowing career
programme in collaboration with employers’ organizations. This approach may have contributed to the significant increase in the female
enrolment rate in STEM higher education of the past decades (Mokgolodi, 2020).
Not all career counselling has a positive influence on reversing students’ traditional choices. In the Netherlands, teaching staff and school
career advisers tend to persuade more boys to choose STEM careers than girls, who sometimes even receive recommendations against
doing so (UNESCO and UNESCO-UNEVOC, 2020).

PreK–12 programme also found that teachers with
limited preparation and command of science content are
less likely to support children’s interest in the discipline
(Ferguson et al., 2022; Mader, 2022).
MULTIPLE OBSTACLES NEED TO BE OVERCOME
TO IMPROVE STEM ASPIRATIONS
Children and youth often develop negative attitudes
towards mathematics and science during their school
years (Tytler et al., 2019). Encouraging student interest is
critical for future education and career choices. In almost
all countries participating in the 2015 PISA, students were
more likely to opt for a science-related career and enrol
in a post-secondary STEM programme if they achieved
a higher science score and if they perceived learning
science as useful. While more time in science subjects is
not necessarily associated with higher achievement, it is
nevertheless linked with higher student interest in jobs
in science and engineering. On average, less than one in
four 15-year-old students from OECD countries expected
a career in STEM (OECD, 2016a). Career counselling and
guidance can help raise students’ aspirations to continue
study and search for work in STEM fields (Box 10.1).

Gender and social identities shape STEM aspirations
Gender is one of the strongest determinants of the
probability to pursue STEM studies and careers, and this
gender divide manifests at a young age. Grade 8 boys were
more willing to pursue a mathematics-related occupation
than their female schoolmates in 87% of the education
systems participating in the 2019 TIMSS. Girls do not
opt for STEM careers even when they are among the top
performers in mathematics (Hencke et al., 2022). These
gaps become entrenched in post-secondary education
(Box 10.2).

Girls do not opt for STEM careers even
when they are among the top performers
in mathematics

Beliefs and dispositions towards mathematics and science
limit girls’ and women’s STEM aspirations, much more than
their performance (DeWitt et al., 2013). It is important to
note that girls achieve the same learning results before
they develop the idea that they are not good enough in
mathematics. They start to show less motivation towards
STEM subjects, particularly in lower secondary education.
This gap is subsequently widened, and results in girls

10

feeling less confident in their capacities – which widens
the gap between them and their male peers even more
(Kuhl et al., 2019). In all participating education systems
in the 2019 TIMSS, boys reported being significantly more
confident in mathematics than girls, with the exception of
Bahrain and Egypt (Hencke et al., 2022).

subjects if their peers view these subjects as inappropriate
for girls (Robnett and Leaper, 2013). In Denmark, a study
on the gender composition of secondary school peers in
the mathematics track showed that having a mother who
is STEM-educated helped mitigate potential negative peer
effects (Brenøe and Zölitz, 2020).

Schools perpetuate gender stereotypes. In Latin America,
between 8% and 20% of mathematics grade 6 teachers
reported believing that their subject is easier for boys
(Treviño et al., 2016). In Greece and Italy, teachers holding
strong implicit gender stereotypes negatively affect girls’
scores in tests, challenging students’ self-confidence and
impacting their future academic choices (Carlana, 2019;
Lavy and Megalokonomou, 2019).

Students from socioeconomically disadvantaged
backgrounds also tend to be less willing to pursue
educational and professional careers in science and
mathematics, even if they achieve good learning outcomes.
High achievers from socioeconomically disadvantaged
households in OECD countries are nearly four times more
likely to aspire for jobs that do not rely on technology and
are at risk of automation (Mann et al., 2020). A survey in
England, United Kingdom, conducted between 2009 and
2018 showed that 17- to 18-year-old students from the
least privileged households were 2.5 times more likely not
to study physics, chemistry and biology than their most
socioeconomically privileged peers (Archer et al., 2020).

Girls’ motivation and confidence in STEM fields are also
influenced by their peers’ expectations, especially during
adolescence. Attitudes of other girls are significant
predictors of interest and confidence in both mathematics
and science (Dasgupta and Stout, 2014; Robnett, 2013).
Young women may be discouraged from taking STEM

B OX 10.2 :

Women are underrepresented in STEM fields in post-secondary education
The various influences that put girls off STEM subjects in compulsory education are crystallized in the education pathways they pursue
once their compulsory education is complete. In 2016–18, women in STEM accounted for only 35% of tertiary education graduates
globally (Figure 10.3). In 15 out of 94 countries, at most one in four graduates were female, including in high-income countries – for
example Chile, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland. By contrast, women constituted more than half of total graduates in six countries,
including Algeria, Oman and Tunisia. The perpetuation of social gender biases and stereotypes is a global phenomenon (Hammond et al.,
2020), but the high share of women choosing STEM in some countries may be explained by the fact that women, despite risks, may have
a greater incentive to take up STEM careers where there are fewer economic opportunities (McNally, 2020).
Within STEM fields, however, there are clear distinctions. Women represented an average of 28% of engineering, manufacturing and
construction tertiary graduates and 30% of ICT tertiary graduates, but 57% of natural sciences, mathematics and statistics graduates –
and more than 80% in Bahrain, Maldives and the United Arab Emirates.
Female students who choose to study in a male-dominated STEM field often experience discrimination and stereotypes, which may
precipitate dropout. In Cabo Verde, Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Malaysia, women are more likely to drop out of STEM faculties. In Kyrgyzstan,
the share of females enrolled in engineering, manufacturing and construction was 34% in 2018, but only 18% completed the programme.
Even with equivalent qualifications, women are less likely to find relevant technology-related jobs. In OECD countries, fewer than one in
three fully employed STEM researchers are women (OECD, 2019d). In the 20 leading economies, women represent 26% of employees in
data and artificial intelligence, 15% in engineering, and 12% in cloud computing (WEF, 2020). In the European Union, one in four women
with a degree in information technology work in digital occupations, compared with more than one in two men. In India, no more than
30% of women work in computer science despite a tertiary enrolment rate in technology studies of 45% (UNESCO and EQUALS Skills
Coalition, 2019).
Women are also less likely to be involved in collaborations that lead to innovation, and female researchers are less likely to register
patents: in 2020, only 16.5% of patent applications were filed by women globally (Kersten and Athanasia, 2022).

Early exposure to STEM has a positive impact
on student attitudes
Beliefs about, and a disposition towards, STEM subjects
are established in early childhood. They tend to remain
stable throughout adolescence, which is the time by which
STEM programmes are generally integrated into the
education system (Archer et al., 2020). Some countries
have integrated STEM studies at lower education levels to
leverage children’s natural predisposition to exploration
and experimentation, which can strengthen student
confidence in learning (Campbell et al., 2018).

Belonging to ethnic and linguistic minorities can also
affect STEM achievement and aspirations. In the
United States, Black and Hispanic students tend to
underperform in mathematics and science compared
with White and Asian students. This increases the
probability that they choose less academic education
tracks and opt out of STEM courses in secondary school
(Alvarado and Muniz, 2018). Analysis of the nationally
representative High School Longitudinal Study has shown
that ethnicity is a significant determinant of developing
and maintaining STEM aspirations, especially when
combined with gender and socioeconomic factors. All girls,
and Black and Hispanic boys from a poor socioeconomic
background are the least likely to show an interest in
STEM education and occupations (Saw et al., 2018).

C H A P T E R 1 0 • E ducation and technology development

Drawing on the well-established Haus der kleinen
Forscher (Little Scientist’s House) programme in
Germany, Australia introduced the Little Scientists
project in the state of New South Wales in 2013 to
promote STEM learning among 3- to 6-year-olds.
Educators were trained to teach STEM through
play-based experiences, and to stimulate children’s
self-directed exploration and positive disposition
towards scientific subjects (MacDonald et al., 2020;
MacDonald et al., 2019). The Little Scientists project
has also been implemented in Thailand since 2010,
in collaboration with the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn
Foundation, where children are engaged in hands-on
science activities using cheap and easy-to-find materials.
As of 2020, the project had reached over 29,000 schools
and 232 networks (East-Asia Association for Science
Education, 2021; Promboon et al., 2018).

10

Children who familiarize themselves with analogue
and digital tools learn progressively how to use various
instruments, apply them in exploring their environment,
and find their own methods and instructions (Early
Childhood STEM Working Group, 2017). Sweden’s
preschool curriculum (Läroplan för Förskolan), revised
in 2018, aims to develop children’s ability to identify
and explore technology and to create using different
techniques and tools by drawing on children’s curiosity
and interest (MacDonald and Huser, 2020;
Swedish National Agency for Education, 2018).
Early STEM learning is also found to help overcome
student gender stereotypes and biases towards
mathematics and science. In 2019, the Colombian Institute
for Family Wellness launched the Pequeñas Aventureras
(Little Adventurers) programme in collaboration with
the Sesame Workshop and the support of Dubai Cares
and the Interamerican Development Bank. Targeting
4- to 5-year-olds, the project draws on the principle that
boys and girls have the same potential in STEM if they
are not exposed to gender stereotypes. Implemented in
661 community-based preschool programmes, mothers
are trained on the use of a digital toolkit, including teaching
guides, tutorials, computer games and interactive posters,
to teach their children STEM-related concepts. Preliminary
evaluation results showed that the initiative reduced
gender as well as race stereotypes among instructors
and contributed to raising children’s interest in STEM
(Inter-American Development Bank, 2022;
Naslund-Hadley and Hernández-Agramonte, 2020).

HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS ARE KEY TO NATIONAL
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
In the triple helix theory of innovation
(Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1995), universities,
governments and businesses take part in research,
development, financing, application and the commercial
use of ideas (Ivanova et al., 2018; Piqué et al., 2018).
Higher education institutions play two key roles
supporting national technological development
(UNESCO-IESALC, 2023). First, they prepare and develop
professional researchers through their teaching and
learning activities (Boulton and Lucas, 2011; Maes, 2010).
Second, they generate knowledge, which forms the basis
for developing technology and innovation, through their
own research activities or in partnership with other actors
(Geschwind et al., 2019; Matherly and Tillman, 2015).
Research production has continued to grow (Box 10.3).
The role of higher education institutions in the promotion
of national technological development is mediated through
two functions: their engagement with governments,

businesses and society; and their organization and
management (UNESCO-IESALC, 2023).
Higher education institutions around the world are
increasingly making more decisions on study
programmes and research portfolios, implementation
of quality standards (Mittelstrass, 2020), recruitment,
promotion and remuneration of researchers, and the
establishment of legal entities and external partnerships
(Cervantes, 2018; OECD, 2019e). In many, though mainly
high-income countries, their governance has been
changing in recent years, gradually leading to more
independence. In the context of national and cross-national
competition for funding and talent, higher education and
research institutions have strengthened their executive
leadership and management structure. They have
adopted a more entrepreneurial approach, developing
strategic objectives and embracing performance-based
management (Benneworth, 2019). They are building
their brands and reputation to gain resources and status
(Huisman and Stensaker, 2022), formally measured
through quantitative indicators and standardized
processes that compare teaching and research activities
across institutions (Musselin, 2018).
Higher education institutions increasingly cooperate
with companies in knowledge creation and technology
development (Ivanova et al., 2018). They engage in basic
research to expand the stock of knowledge but need
partners to apply their research and leverage technological
progress. They are therefore seeking new funding
mechanisms more and more (Fan et al., 2021). Globally,
in 2018, private enterprises accounted for an estimated
60% of gross domestic expenditure on research and
development (GERD) (UIS, 2018).
Close collaboration between universities and industry
arguably erodes the boundaries between basic and applied
research, and between the public and private sectors
(Ulrichsen and Kelleher, 2021). The flow of researchers
from higher education institutions to the private sector
is estimated to have grown between 2000 and 2020.
Those individuals most likely to move are high-performing
professionals, as measured by the number of citations
(Jurowetzki et al., 2021). In addition to better compensation
and generous benefits, researchers are attracted by
the opportunity to study large data sets that they
cannot access in universities. New industry–university
collaboration opportunities may therefore be putting
higher education institutions at a disadvantage, with
companies stealing academic brain power while gaining
capacity and influence to define the technology research
agenda (Woolston, 2022).

B OX 10.3:

Research activity leading to technological
development and innovation is growing
In 2018, there were more than 8.8 million full-time equivalent
researchers in the world, compared with 7.8 million in
2014 (UNESCO, 2021). It is estimated that most researchers
work in STEM fields. In 2018, more than 80% of full-time
professional researchers in OECD countries were engaged in
the field of natural sciences and engineering (OECD, 2018d).
Publications and patents suggest the volume of research
production and their focus (Inglesi-Lotz et al., 2018).
According to Scopus, an academic publication database, more
than 2.5 million publications were published in 2019, up by
21% compared to 2015. Health accounted for 34% of total
output in 2019. Cross-cutting ‘strategic’ technologies, a
catch-all term capturing a broad field from artificial intelligence
to energy and from materials science to biotechnology,
accounted for 18%, up by one third relative to
2015 (UNESCO, 2021).
Patents are a form of intellectual property representing
a product or process that grants a new technical solution
(WIPO, 2022c). Patent applications have shifted towards
digital technology. Between 2010 and 2020, over 10% of filed
patents in the world were in computer technologies (WIPO,
2022d). In OECD countries, the largest number of filed patents
in 2018, about one third of the total, were in information
and communications technology, followed by climate change
mitigation (13%) and medical technology (9%) (OECD, 2018b).
Publications and patents also provide a rough estimate of a
country’s propensity and capacity to create knowledge (Hall
and Jaffe, 2018). Their concentration among richer countries
signals inequalities in innovation capacity. G20 countries
contribute 91% of scientific publications. China and the United
States lead the group, producing one fourth and one fifth of
global publications, respectively, and holding the highest share
of patents. In 2019, data from the five biggest patent offices
showed that China produced 29% and the United States 20% of
total global patents (UNESCO, 2021).

Influence flows in both directions. Universities seek
external, non-academic members for their governance.
A survey in 34 OECD countries showed that more than
80% of higher education governing bodies include
representatives of the private sector, civil society and
professionals. Industries, including small and medium
enterprises, participate in university governance in about
three quarters of the participating countries. As a result,
private actors may contribute to defining institutions’

191

C H A P T E R 1 0 • E ducation and technology development

research agenda (OECD, 2019e), and to reviewing and
defining the content of higher education programmes
(Ankrah and Omar, 2015).
University–industry collaboration is associated with
national innovation capacity. According to the World
Intellectual Property Organization’s Global Innovation
Index 2022, which measures the innovation ecosystem
performance of 132 participating economies, the most
innovative economies tend to have high scores in the
university–industry collaboration indicator. The indicator
was based on an opinion survey conducted by the World
Economic Forum in 2021, which found that businesses
and universities in Israel, Switzerland and the
United States exhibited the highest degree of
collaboration (WIPO, 2022a, 2022b).
GOVERNMENTS USE VARIOUS FUNDING
MECHANISMS TO INFLUENCE RESEARCH PRIORITIES
A country’s innovation capacity is also linked to
the financial resources dedicated to research and
development (Afzal et al., 2020). Globally, GERD as a
share of gross domestic product (GDP) by governments,
higher education institutions, the private sector and
non-profit organizations increased from 1.5% in 2000 to
1.9% in 2020. The growth has been fastest in Eastern and
South-eastern Asia (from 1.5% to 2.3%), which has the
second largest share after Europe and Northern America
(2.6%). By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa (0.3%), Central
and Southern Asia (0.6%) and Latin America and the
Caribbean (0.6%) have seen no change in 20 years. Globally,
engineering and technology are the fields receiving the
largest share of funding, about 30% of the total GERD
(UIS, 2018).
Governments are the main funders of research and
development, accounting for 54% of the total, and the
main support for higher education institutions research
activities (UIS, 2018). Through funding allocations,
governments set national priorities that higher
education and research institutions are called to follow
in their research activities (OECD, 2021a). In some
richer countries, public higher education and research
institutions have seen a shift from block funding to
competitive funding allocation with increasing attention
to cost efficiency (Broström et al., 2021; Lewis, 2015).
This is partly a consequence of increased autonomy for
universities that receive public funds, which has come with
more regulation and quality assurance mechanisms. These
have transformed government–university relationships.
As states maintain an interest in particular areas, they bind
higher education institutions and research institutes to
deliver specific outcomes in exchange for resources

10

(Scott, 2020). Contrary to institutional block funding,
project-based funding has defined timelines and targets
(Borowiecki and Paunov, 2018). Targets may be related to
revenues from research transfer (e.g. in Austria), research
quality and productivity (e.g. in the United Kingdom)
and the number of awarded grants (e.g. in Ireland;
Tennessee, United States). They may also impose
education objectives on institutions, such as a requirement
for a certain number of students obtaining doctoral
degrees (e.g. in the Netherlands) (Jongbloed et al., 2018).
Performance-based funding departs from one-size-fits-all
formulas and focuses on predefined and quantifiable
indicators that assign a particular value to scientific
research. Greater emphasis is placed on the need to reward
research excellence (Jongbloed et al., 2018;
Sørensen et al., 2016). Introduced in 2005,
the Exzellenzinitiative in Germany provides additional
funding to universities whose research projects comply
with criteria of excellence. Among them, Future Concepts
(Zukunftskonzepte) are the most prestigious. With a
budget of USD 4.7 billion, or 4% of all research funds to
universities, the initiative supports higher education
research activities to boost the international standing of
universities and to stimulate competition between them
(Buenstorf and Koenig, 2020; Mergele and Winkelmayer,
2021).
Yet competitive funding also has its downsides. Studies
on the effects of competitive funding in Japan show
that performance-based funding may have reduced the
originality of filed patents. In Japan, institutional funding
coexists with a more market-oriented incentive system,
introduced in the early 2000s. The increased push for
competitive project grants may have led higher education
institutions to perform incremental, low-risk research.
Male and senior researchers were more likely to see their
innovative applications accepted, suggesting that the
system was less receptive to novel ideas from young
and female researchers (Wang et al., 2018).
In Africa, centres of excellence have been established
in various countries since the mid-2000s to promote
scientific and technological research. Research projects
are sponsored through research excellence grants which,
however, often do not define clear criteria of excellence
(Tijssen and Kraemer-Mbula, 2018). Awards are based
on visibility and reputation over their actual capacity
and potential for developing local technology
(Tijssen and Winnink, 2022).
Governments in high-income countries have been
diversifying their financial support for research and
development to cover not only universities but also

private companies (Hutschenreiter et al., 2019),
notably through tax incentives (OECD, 2021a). This
is because the knowledge produced by enterprises
contributes to economic growth and competitiveness
and the benefits are estimated to have large social
returns (Lach et al., 2021). Governments also try to
encourage small and medium enterprises and start-ups
to engage in research and promote experimental
development for market applications (OECD, 2020b).
Tax exemptions apply on both research outputs, such
as generated income, and on inputs, such as equipment
(Hall, 2022).
Specific interests may influence publicly sponsored research
Leading countries which produce research report a large
share of business contributions to domestic research
funding. In 2017, private companies financed more than
three quarters of national research and development
activities in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea and
more than two thirds in Germany and Switzerland
(UIS, 2018).
Private funding of academic research is not without
controversy, as it is likely to be biased towards areas that
bring higher financial returns. For example, the private
sector is the primary source of global health research and
development. Private companies are found to invest more
in research on diseases with greater incidence in developed
countries that bring larger returns. By contrast, public
and philanthropic sectors are more likely to allocate
funding to neglected diseases (85%), which are a greater
burden in terms of the size of populations affected
(Anderson et al., 2017).

There are risks that the processes and
outcomes of research may be distorted
to favour those who pay for it

There are risks that the processes and outcomes of
research may be distorted to favour those who pay for it.
Private interests can influence the choice of experimental
design, framing questions and analyses. Often sponsored
by pharmaceutical companies, clinical research can
lead to biases (Lundh et al., 2018). For example, trials
conducted on the effects of the use of Bisphenol A,
a synthetic chemical, in food and beverage cans led to
different results depending on the sponsor. About 90% of
publicly funded research has shown that even low-dose
exposure to Bisphenol A could be dangerous to human

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

192

10

health. By contrast, industry-funded studies reported no
effects. These conclusions may have been manipulated
through research design (Reutlinger, 2020). In 2008,
striking findings from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the United States federal public health agency,
led industries to reduce the use of the substance. It is only
recently that scientists and regulators worldwide have
been discussing the harmfulness of even minimal levels of
exposure to Bisphenol A (Henderson, 2022).
Public research and development may also be vulnerable
to specific interests. Unlike health, most global agricultural
research is publicly funded. Private research and
development, including in Asia and Latin America, focus on
market-oriented crops, such as corn and wheat, that are
more likely to be consumed in high-income countries and
present higher net returns. But public sources also tend to
support research in crops with high production value.
Many publicly funded researchers in South and
South-eastern Asia study market-oriented crops, which
raises the question whether such research could not have
been funded by private industry (Anderson et al., 2017).
UNIVERSITIES RECEIVE SUPPORT TO TURN
KNOWLEDGE INTO INNOVATION
National technological development requires the results
of research to be diffused into the economy. This process
often starts with training researchers to pursue such
opportunities. Some higher education programmes
integrate content focusing on science commercialization
and technology transfer processes (Bolzani et al., 2021;
Spiel et al., 2018). Science departments are more likely
to promote an entrepreneurship culture (Kaloudis et al.,
2019). Innovation and entrepreneurship courses have been
rapidly growing in medical education in the United States.
Most teach innovation concepts, notions of leadership
and information about healthcare systems and the
business of medicine (Niccum et al., 2017). Universities
in Zambia promote digital marketing and business
training through the Zambia AgriBusiness BootCamp
programme, implemented by BongoHive, an innovation
and technology hub active in different sectors. Started
in 2018, and supported by the World Bank, it provides
entrepreneurial training to agro-processing companies
(FAO and ITU, 2022; UNCTAD, 2019).
A survey of 166 universities, carried out by the European
University Association, found that relatively few students
had received entrepreneurship training and, if so, mostly
through extracurricular activities. Limited exposure
during compulsory schooling further contributes to low
awareness and interest (Kozirog et al., 2022). A survey by
the University Commercialisation and Innovation Policy

193

C H A P T E R 1 0 • E ducation and technology development

Evidence Unit of the National Centre for Universities and
Business in the United Kingdom found that universities
have a growing interest in collaborating with external
partners for prototyping, demonstrating and testing of
technological products (Coates Ulrichsen, 2021).
Higher education institutions have developed multiple
mechanisms to apply technology innovations to industry
(Knudsen et al., 2021). Technology transfer offices are
intermediary organizations in the knowledge transfer
process, helping to map existing inventions, maintain
relationships with private companies and support
scientists in the patent application process
(Holgersson and Aaboen, 2019).
Since 2013, Colombia has strengthened six regional
technology transfer offices, as part of a series of policies
aimed at promoting technology transfer between
universities and businesses. Established through a public
call launched by the Science, Technology and Innovation
Administrative Agency, technology transfer offices were
identified as a key instrument for enhancing innovation
by the National Development Plans 2010–14 and
2014–18. A National Network of Regional Technology
Transfer Offices has aimed to strengthen their capacity
and encourage resource sharing. External reviews have
shown that technology transfer offices have supported
specific technology transfer projects in the field of water
management, pharmaceutical treatments and paediatric
care (OECD, 2019e; Pontón et al., 2019).
Science and technology parks are another example of joint
efforts of universities, industry and government to create
and transfer knowledge. They promote networks within
which technology-oriented companies, their research
departments, and academics interact and collaborate,
encouraged by close proximity and a favourable
regulatory framework. The objective is to draw on existing
knowledge-based institutions to promote a culture of
innovation and promote local and regional social and
economic development (Löfsten et al., 2020). Science and
technology parks have spread worldwide, starting from
the Silicon Valley example in the 1950s, initiated by
Stanford University. They may also be promoted by
industries, as in the case of Ideon Science Park, in Lund,
Sweden or by governments through incentives to firms,
such as the Beijing Zhongguancun Science Park in China
(Etzkowitz and Zhou, 2018).
By contrast, the sustainability of digital hubs in Africa has
been challenged by the lack of strong knowledge-based
institutions. Several national and international initiatives
have promoted digital-oriented economic development
in the continent, including through the establishment of

it is estimated that beneficiaries of grants related
to STEM fields of study in higher and graduate
education have accounted for 31% of global recipients
(Scholarships for Change, 2022).

technology parks, such as Konza City in Kenya, CcHub in
Lagos, Nigeria, MEST in Accra, Ghana, and kLab in Kigali,
Rwanda. However, the lower capacity of higher education
institutions to support entrepreneurs means there are
fewer opportunities for technology diversification and
specialization (Friederici et al., 2020).
UNIVERSITIES AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS COMPETE
FOR TALENT WORLDWIDE
Globalization and the internationalization of higher
education have intensified competition for talented
students, especially in the STEM fields. Although the
number of students spending a period of study abroad
represents only 2.7% of students in tertiary education
in 2020, this share has tripled in the last decades and is
expected to represent 8 million students by 2025
(UIS, 2019; UNESCO, 2022b). International students in
most host countries are more likely to study in STEM

In middle-income countries, scholarships promote
study experiences abroad (Kent, 2018; University
of Oxford, 2017). Launched in 2011, the Brazilian
Scientific Mobility Programme Ciência sem Fronteiras
(Science without borders) was one of the largest
government-sponsored scholarship programmes for
national students in STEM. From 2012 to 2015, Brazilian
undergraduates and graduate students benefited from
101,000 fully funded scholarships to conduct research
or complete their studies abroad, mostly in Europe and
the United States (Brazil Ministry of Education and Brazil
Ministry of Science, 2013). Of those, 45% were engaged
in engineering and technology fields, followed by biology,
biomedical sciences and health (18%) and the creative
industries (9%). In 2015, the results of a survey conducted
by the Brazilian Senate’s Office of Transparency reported
that 28% of the participants enrolled in master of
science (M.Sc.) and doctorate (Ph.D.) programmes,
compared with 7% of undergraduates without international
study experience (Menino, 2017; Zahler and Menino,
2018). Launched in 2005, the King Abdullah Scholarship
Programme in Saudi Arabia is another ambitious initiative
(Pavan, 2020). Renewed in 2019 for five additional years,
it supports some 130,000 Saudi undergraduate students
per year in STEM studies (Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission,
2023).
High-income countries tend to attract STEM students
from other countries to study in their higher education
institutions (Kent, 2018). Across OECD countries, 8% of

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

10

international students were in STEM studies, compared
to 5% of national students (OECD, 2021c). In the
United States, international students accounted for 4%
of tertiary students in 2021. Of those, 54% were enrolled
in STEM programmes (Institute of International Education,
2021; Marsh and Oyelere, 2018).
Existing mobility flows have created great
imbalances between receiving and sending countries
(Marinoni and de Wit, 2019). Countries with a high level
of outbound mobility flows see their best students leaving
and, with them, human capital for future innovation
and development (Baxter, 2018). In the past 15 years,
new destinations have challenged the traditional mobility
flows of skilled students (Marsh and Oyelere, 2018).
The United Arab Emirates reports the highest increase in
the proportion of tertiary students coming from abroad,
from 43% in 2011 to 73% in 2020 (UIS, 2019). This trend is
the result of targeted policies aiming to make the country a
regional higher-education hub through a general expansion
of provision and the establishment of private institutions
and international campuses (Ahmad and Hussain, 2015).
With 30 international campuses, the United Arab
Emirates is the second largest host country per number
of international campuses after China (Cross-Border
Education Research Team, 2022).

Countries have implemented policies to
encourage professionals educated in strategic
fields abroad to return

C H A P T E R 1 0 • E ducation and technology development

As a countermeasure, countries have implemented
policies to encourage professionals educated in strategic
fields abroad to return. After a significant brain drain
in the 1990s, China has become one of the most active
countries in reattracting talent. In 2008, the Hundred
Talents Programme aimed to attract 2,000 professionals
and scholars with key knowledge and skills in emerging
technological fields through social and financial
measures, including salary compensations, education and
housing subsidies and allowances, and research grants
(Campbell and Neff, 2020; Zha and Wang, 2018). By 2015,
the programme recruited more than 3,000 top-tier
professionals. In 2011, the Thousand Youth Talents
Programme was designed to attract long-term returnees
up to 40 years old who obtained a doctoral degree in
STEM in a foreign university (Li et al., 2018).
As a common instruction language, English has ensured
the circulation and the exchange of professionals and of
scientific and technological knowledge (Schofer et al.,
2021). Worldwide, English-taught programmes outside
native-speaking countries, such as Australia, Canada,
the United States and the United Kingdom, increased
by 77% between 2017 and 2021. Among them, STEM
programmes, including engineering and technology,
computer science and information technology, are the
most represented, accounting for about one fifth of the
portfolio of English degrees in non-native English-speaking
countries. The largest increase was registered in China and
in sub-Saharan Africa (British Council, 2021).

CONCLUSION
Learning about technology is critical for supporting
national technological development. As a stand-alone
subject or integrated into other disciplines, STEM has
been included in most secondary education systems in the
world. However, the quality of provision makes a difference
in student performance and aspirations to continue
studying and working in these fields.

The quality of provision makes a difference
in student performance and aspirations to
continue studying and working in these fields

In addition to teaching and learning, higher education
institutions are responsible for knowledge creation
through research activity. With more institutional
autonomy and new forms of government funding and
support, universities continue to play a key role in leading
technological development. The capacity to innovate is
associated with resources, and, increasingly, with their
collaboration with industry.

KE Y MESSAGES
By June 2022, three in four countries had committed to national targets on seven SDG 4 benchmark indicators to be
achieved by 2025 and 2030.
In January 2023, the UIS and the GEM Report published the first annual snapshot of country progress towards these
national targets, SDG 4 Scorecard: Progress Report on National Benchmarks.
Among countries with benchmarks and data, the share of those on course to achieve their 2025 benchmark with high
probability was 29% for the upper secondary completion rate and 43% for the early childhood education participation
rate.
Poorer countries set overambitious targets on learning, a sign of lack of data and awareness in this area, while richer
countries set underambitious targets, reflecting falling achievement levels. By contrast, the targets countries set on
completion reflect past trends.
The national benchmarking process is meant not only to serve accountability purposes but also to be formative. SDG
4 Scorecard discussed country progress in early childhood education participation with reference to three policies:
free and compulsory pre-primary education legislation, financing, and private provider regulation.
The 2022 Transforming Education Summit was part of the UN Secretary-General’s vision for the future of
international cooperation and a step towards the 2024 Summit of the Future. It was the most important event in the
global education calendar since 2015.
The national SDG 4 benchmarks, already embedded in the 2015 Framework for Action, were recognized in the UN
Secretary-General’s vision statement on the 2022 Transforming Education Summit as a mechanism to monitor its
high-level outcomes.
The SDG 4 High-level Steering Committee’s Call to Action invited Member States to identify a benchmark indicator
for three of the 2022 summit’s global initiatives and set national targets:

201



On greening education, the proposed measure focuses on the extent to which curriculum frameworks and primary
and secondary education syllabuses prioritize climate change.



On digital transformation, school internet connectivity, an existing global SDG 4 indicator, is the proposed measure.



On youth participation, an indicator will need to confirm that governments invite youth to participate in education
policy development, and that youth organizations are consulted.

A

s 2023 marks the midpoint in the implementation
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
the primary focus of the monitoring part of this year’s
Global Education Monitoring Report is key trends by each
SDG 4 target. While it is always difficult to provide the
up-to-date situation – as education data inevitably lag
considerably – some methodological developments,
to which this report has contributed, facilitate the ability
to ‘nowcast’, i.e. make reasonably reliable short-term
projections for some flagship indicators.
But even these tools have been put to the test as a result
of the disruption to education data collection processes
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate effects
of school closures on education systems remain unknown
and will unfold over the coming years. This is particularly
the case for learning, where no shock at such a large
scale had ever been experienced, from which potential
consequences could be assessed. The first evidence from
the world’s richer countries documented a negative effect
but less dramatic than feared. However, evidence from
the world’s poorer countries, some of which experienced
an unfortunate combination of long school closures and
limited distance education opportunities, is yet to emerge.
In any case, the gap in data on learning outcomes remains
a cause for concern and an area where global action
remains elusive.
This introductory chapter to the monitoring part of the
report presents four issues. First, it gives an update on
the national SDG 4 benchmarking process, arguably the
most important development for framing the monitoring
of the global education agenda, with potential lessons for
other sectors. Second, it describes the 2022 Transforming
Education Summit, the most important event in the global
education calendar since 2015, which facilitated reflection
on new education challenges as well as on monitoring,
building on the benchmarking process. Third, it presents
some of the key features of the monitoring part of the
report and its links with this year’s theme: technology.
Finally, it gives an overview of the GEM Report's outputs
since 2015 to orient readers to the multiple resources
at their disposal in interpreting progress towards the
2030 goal.

THE NATIONAL SDG 4 BENCHMARKING
PROCESS HAS REACHED A MILESTONE
Inspired by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General’s
2014 call for countries to embrace ‘a culture of shared
responsibility’ based on ‘benchmarking for progress’,
paragraph 28 of the Education 2030 Framework for
Action had called on countries to establish ‘appropriate
intermediate benchmarks … for addressing the
accountability deficit associated with longer-term targets’.
The GEM Report and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics
(UIS) began working in 2018 to make this commitment a
reality.
There have been three important markers of progress in
this process. First, in August 2019, seven SDG 4 indicators
were selected for benchmarking: early childhood education
attendance; out-of-school rates; completion rates; gender
gaps in completion rates; minimum proficiency rates in
reading and mathematics; trained teachers; and public
education expenditure. This development was captured
in the SDG 4 Data Digest 2021 report (UIS and GEM Report,
2021).
Second, in two stages, by October 2021 and June 2022,
three in four countries committed to national targets on
these indicators to be achieved by 2025 and 2030. These
benchmark values define countries’ nationally determined
contributions to the common education goal, using a
concept embraced by the climate change sector. They
enable the monitoring of progress to be context-specific,
recognizing countries’ starting points and education
sector plans, helping link their national education agendas
with regional and global agendas. These developments
were described in the Setting Commitments report, which
was presented at the High-level Political Forum and
the Transforming Education Summit in 2022 (UIS and
GEM Report, 2022).
Third, in January 2023, a milestone was reached: the first
annual snapshot of country progress towards national
targets was published. Entitled SDG 4 Scorecard: Progress
Report on National Benchmarks, this first report of what is
intended to be an annual series to mark the International
Day of Education makes four contributions (UIS and
GEM Report, 2023).
First, it analyses historical progress rates between
2000 and 2015: how the change in benchmark indicator
values has varied according to the starting point. This
analysis provided a measure of what countries will achieve
if they accelerate progress, move at a ‘business as usual’
pace or perform under par.

11

Second, the Scorecard describes the steps the UIS took
to set up the benchmark database, which highlighted the
strong political will to support the benchmarking process
and the rich information in national education sector
plans, but also continuing challenges of communication on
indicator definitions and data sources.
Third, it classifies countries’ progress in terms of the
probability they will achieve their national targets by 2025.
For instance, among countries with benchmarks and data,
29% in the upper secondary completion rate and 43% in the
participation rate in organized learning one year before
primary were on course to achieve their 2025 benchmark
with high probability. The report also shows how a
country’s progress in 2015–20 compares with the
historical progress rates in 2000–15 of the average
country that had started from a similar point.
Fourth, the Scorecard makes a clear statement that
reporting on benchmarks must not be the end but the
beginning of a process to engage countries to learn from
one another.

Benchmark values define countries’ nationally
determined contributions to the common
education goal, using a concept embraced by
the climate change sector
The benchmarking process is designed to allow countries
to achieve two objectives critical for their education
development. The first is to help countries reflect on the
quality of their national targets and improve them to serve
their policy and planning. As part of the process, every
country was provided with indicative ‘feasible’ benchmark
values by the UIS and the GEM Report, which show where
countries could be by 2025 and 2030 if they grew at the
historic rate of the fastest 25% of countries.
A review of how benchmark values set by countries
compare with indicative feasible benchmark values is
instructive of the challenges countries face in setting
benchmarks. The wide discrepancy between benchmarks
and feasible benchmarks is found in minimum proficiency
levels, for instance in reading at the end of primary
education (Figure 11.1a). On average, countries with low
starting values are far more ambitious than indicated
by feasible benchmark values, while countries with
high starting values are less ambitious. This may be
because this indicator was only added to the education
monitoring framework in 2015: poorer countries lack
data and are less familiar with progress in this area.
By contrast, richer countries have been taking part in

203

C H A P T E R 1 1 • I ntroduction

cross-national assessments for the past 20 years and
are more familiar with the indicator and progress on it.
In fact, indicator levels in richer countries with high initial
learning levels (more than 70% of students achieving
minimum proficiency) fell on average between 2000 and
2015 (Chapter 12), which may explain why these countries
have been more cautious in setting their national targets.
By contrast, the discrepancy in completion
rate – an indicator with a trajectory far more familiar to
countries – is considerably smaller (Figure 11.1b). Again,
a few countries with low starting values have been too
ambitious. This may be explained by their inexperience or a
lack of precedent in national target setting. However, fewer
countries have been as ambitious in this indicator as they
were for learning.
The second objective is to link indicator levels and progress
with the policies countries need to implement. Each
edition of the SDG 4 Scorecard focuses on one benchmark
indicator; the first looks at the participation rate in
organized learning one year before primary. It discusses
country progress with reference to three policies: free
and compulsory pre-primary education legislation, public
education financing, and private provider regulation.
The introduction of three years of free education in
Armenia, four years in Uzbekistan and three – and later
five – years in Azerbaijan is associated with a large
increase in participation rates (Chapter 13). Doubling
spending from 0.25% to 0.50% of GDP is associated with a
tripling of the participation rate in public institutions from
20% to 60% on average. And the early childhood education
participation rate is 7 percentage points higher in countries
with private preschool fee-setting regulations (UIS and
GEM Report, 2023).
Various challenges will need to be tackled in the coming
years. Countries need help to set missing education
targets and address a lack of alignment between national
and global indicators. A process of dialogue and capacity
development is recommended. Finally, countries will need
to incorporate the potential effects of COVID-19 in their
national benchmarks.
In summary, the GEM Report is providing a global update
on progress towards the targets of universal access to
education, the provision of key minimum inputs and the
achievement of relevant learning outcomes, as agreed in
2015. The partnership with the UIS through the national
SDG 4 benchmarking process offers a new perspective
on how progress can be monitored and assessed in a way
that is closely linked to national starting points and plans;
is fair for every country; and helps bridge the gap between
national, regional and global commitments.

FOLLOWING UP ON THE TRANSFORMING
EDUCATION SUMMIT COMMITMENTS
When the UN Member States adopted a declaration on
the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United
Nations (the ‘UN75 Declaration’), the UN Secretary-General
was asked to outline a vision for the future of
international cooperation. His report, Our Common Agenda,
was conceived as the first step towards a Summit of the
Future in 2024 in which ‘to forge a new global consensus
on what our future should look like, and what we can
do today to secure it’ (United Nations, 2021). While the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development captures the
scope of international ambition and provides a framework
and a mechanism for its fulfilment, Our Common Agenda
aimed to address the obstacles to realizing this agenda.
With education high on the UN Secretary-General’s
priorities, a key step in the process towards the Summit
of the Future was the Transforming Education Summit
(the ‘Summit’), which took place in September 2022 ‘in
response to a global crisis in education – one of equity and
inclusion, quality and relevance’.
The Summit aimed to elevate education to the top of the
global political agenda and to galvanize action, ambition,
solidarity and solutions to achieve two objectives: recover

from the learning losses brought about by COVID-19 and
sow the seeds to transform education in a rapidly
changing world. As part of its preparation, more than
150 education ministers gathered in Paris in June 2022 at
the Pre-Summit, where discussions were organized along
five thematic action tracks: inclusive, equitable, safe
and healthy schools; learning and skills for life, work and
sustainable development; teachers, teaching and the
teaching profession; digital learning and transformation;
and education financing. At the Summit itself, the key
outcome was seven global initiatives related to: education
in emergencies; foundational learning; gender equality;
greening education; digital transformation; education
financing; and youth participation.
From a monitoring perspective, the Summit presented
the challenge of how to match the SDG 4 targets and
monitoring framework with the priorities expressed in the
global initiatives and then to report on achievements to
inform policy dialogue.
Two steps were taken. First, in his Vision Statement
at the Transforming Education Summit, the UN
Secretary-General called for ‘ways to strengthen political
accountability for transforming and financing
education, taking current arrangements for monitoring

11

SDG 4 implementation, including the Global Education
Meetings and the national SDG 4 benchmarking
process, to the next level’ (United Nations, 2022).
The national SDG 4 benchmarks, which are embedded
in the 2015 Framework for Action, were therefore also
recognized as a cornerstone of monitoring the high-level
outcomes of the 2022 Transforming Education Summit.
Second, a call to action was issued by the SDG 4 High-level
Steering Committee (High-level Steering Committee,
2022). The call recognized that selected SDG 4 benchmark
indicators were appropriate for monitoring four of the
seven global initiatives proposed during the Summit:
education in emergencies, foundational learning, gender
equality and education financing. It further urged countries
to build on the national SDG 4 benchmarking process by:




Agreeing to set an indicator for each of the three
other global initiatives (greening education, digital
transformation and youth participation) that would be
added to the list of seven SDG 4 benchmark indicators.
Setting national targets for these indicators for 2025
and 2030, which would represent the countries’
intended outcomes from the Transforming Education
Summit.

At its meeting in December 2022, the High-level Steering
Committee decided to add indicators for greening
education, digital transformation, and youth and student
engagement to the existing SDG 4 benchmark indicator
framework (Figure 11.2). Preliminary ideas on benchmark
indicators for these three global initiatives were proposed
to the Technical Cooperation Group on SDG 4 Indicators.

205

C H A P T E R 1 1 • I ntroduction

Relating to greening education, an initiative which consists
of four dimensions (schools, learning, teachers and
communities), the main indicator proposal is a measure
of national intentions to cover climate change based on
an analysis of relevant policy documents; this indicator
has already been estimated based on keyword searches
of more than 170 national curriculum frameworks for
133 countries. Further information will be added from
science and social science syllabi in primary and secondary
education.
In terms of digital transformation, the global initiative
consists of three dimensions: content, capacity and
connectivity. While no indicator can cover all aspects
comprehensively, school internet connectivity has the
advantage that it is an existing global SDG 4 indicator
(4.a.1) and is therefore being monitored by countries and
reported at the international level. In the coming years,
improvements can be made in how the indicator is sourced,
such as adding information from internet service providers.
A potential indicator on the youth participation global
initiative will involve, first, governments reporting whether
they have an education policy development council or
related body that includes youth representatives; and
second, youth organizations reporting whether they are
active members of such a council or body and have been
consulted in education policy development.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2023 GEM REPORT
MONITORING PART
As described previously, the first objective of the
monitoring part of the 2023 GEM Report is to provide
a concise measurement of progress towards the
2030 targets. A box in each chapter provides a snapshot
of such progress for at least one global indicator.
The remainder of the main text analyses developments in
other global and thematic indicators.
A second objective of the monitoring part of the
2023 GEM Report is to identify one or more issues per
target that connect with the thematic part. These focus
sections make various links with the theme of technology
in education.
Some focus sections examine aspects of digital
technology. For instance, they look at issues such as how
technology affects definitions of writing skills (Focus 12.1),
active play outdoors in early childhood education as an
alternative to screen time (Focus 13.1), micro-credentials
facilitated by online technology as an alternative to
traditional higher education (Focus 14.1), the potential
effect of artificial intelligence technology on skill demand
and supply (Focus 15.1), the elevated attention assigned
to social and emotional learning and how theories about it
inform education technology (Focus 18.1), and the role of
big data in identifying education trends with an application
on the use of online searches to understand interest in
international scholarships (Focus 20.1).

C H A P T E R 1 1 • I ntroduction

An extensive analysis shows the financing gap that the
GEM Report team has estimated will need to be filled for
low- and lower-middle-income countries to achieve their
national SDG 4 benchmarks, with new evidence on how the
gap would increase if countries were to cover the cost of
digital transformation in education under three scenarios
of increasing ambition (Chapter 22).
One focus is related to how education can influence
technology adoption, adjustment and development instead
of how technology influences education – and examines
shortages in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics teachers (Focus 21.1).
Four focus sections look at technologies other than
information and communication: construction and school
buildings (Focus 19.1), energy and closing the school
electrification gap through solar panels (Focus 19.2),
transport and the impact of commuting to school
(Focus 19.3), and agriculture linked to improving school
meals (Focus 12.2).
Finally, other focus sections look at selected issues of
interest unrelated to technology: inequality based on
parental education with an emphasis on first-generation
students (Focus 16.1), the significance of reading speed
for literacy (Focus 17.1), and the concern about the
potential impact of an impending debt crisis in low- and
lower-middle-income countries (Chapter 22).

THE GEM REPORT IS MORE THAN JUST A
REPORT
The world is very different today than in 2001 when the
decision was taken to establish the Education for All Global
Monitoring Report as an editorially independent report
hosted and published by UNESCO. It has even changed
considerably since 2015, when the decision was taken to
give the Global Education Monitoring Report the mandate
to monitor progress in education in the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. The changes are not just
related to the political, social, economic and environmental
challenges, which provide the framework in which the
report operates. They are also related to the much larger
volumes of information that are available to report on
education, the many more channels through which
audiences are now used to receiving such information,
and the pluralism in voices that these channels help bring.
For a report designed from the outset to combine the
twin functions of research and advocacy, there are also
changing expectations of what should be delivered.
The GEM Report could not stay the same as its mandate
expanded to cover a universal education agenda for
all countries and all levels of education. It developed a
strategy for 2019–24 on the focus and form of its outputs
within a constant resource envelope. The strategy set two
priorities: fulfil its expanded mandate to be a truly global
education reporting mechanism while tailoring its outputs
and communication channels to increase opportunities to
influence policy change.
Today, the GEM Report is more than just a report. It offers
a range of resources: global and regional, in a few targeted
cases, also national; monitoring and quantitative but
also thematic and qualitative; indicators on outputs and
outcomes but also on laws and policies; in print and online;
static and interactive; organized by different themes;
presented in numerous settings; and communicated
through various channels. The outputs feed into and
inform each other (Figure 11.3). This expansion has been
possible through this synergy and coherence but also
thanks to invaluable partnerships with a committed group
of organizations around the world.

KE Y MESSAGES
A new methodology combining multiple data sources indicated that some 244 million children and youth were out
of school in 2021, 9 million less than in 2015. During this period, the out-of-school population in sub-Saharan Africa
grew by 12 million.
Completion rates have improved faster than out-of-school rates. Globally, the completion rate increased between
2015 and 2021 from 85% to 87% in primary education, from 74% to 77% in lower secondary education and from 54%
to 59% in upper secondary education. Many children in low-income countries complete primary school late, which
impedes their progression.
Since 2011, the share of students with at least minimum proficiency in reading at the end of primary education has
increased faster in low- and lower-middle-income countries, albeit from low starting points, than in upper-middleand high-income countries.
In 21 of 32 mostly upper-middle- and high-income countries, grade 4 students performed worse in reading in 2021
than in 2016, although the average decline was only one fifth of what children learn in a school year. Low- and
middle-income countries appear to have suffered a stronger impact, with some findings suggesting children lost at
least one year of learning, but comparable evidence post-COVID-19 is not yet available.
Writing is a technology. Although it is rarely included in standardized learning assessments, research suggests that
improving writing proficiency is more strongly associated with the frequency of writing tasks than with how it is
done (handwriting, typing or a combination of both).

ACCESS AND COMPLETION

It was recognized in the early 2000s that the
traditional way of estimating out-of-school
rates and numbers was falling short of the
requirements

T

he number of out-of-school children of primary school
age was the flagship indicator of the international
education agenda from 2000 until 2015. It was easy to
communicate and powerful in presentation. It also seemed
to be straightforward to calculate, based on a headcount
of children in school, although a reliable population
measure was often not available. It was selected even
though it did not capture the second Education for All goal
(‘all children … have access to, and complete, free and
compulsory primary education’) nor the second Millennium
Development Goal (‘children everywhere … complete a full
course of primary schooling’). In fact, the out-of-school
indicator showed exaggerated progress, as access to
school does not mean progression and completion, as the
international community came to realize over time through
better statistics. Moreover, the indicator encouraged
countries to bring and keep children in school – but made
them less accountable for ensuring that children finished
each education level or that children learned what was
expected.
It was recognized in the early 2000s that the traditional
way of estimating out-of-school rates and numbers
was falling short of the requirements. Many countries,
especially some of those with the largest out-of-school
challenges, did not have robust administrative data
systems. Education data reporting has been incomplete
or inaccurate, while in some country-year combinations,
there has been no reporting at all. As well, given the
two-source nature of the administrative estimates, there
are often inconsistencies between enrolment counts and

population estimates. Data from household surveys offer
crucial complementary insights, especially in countries
with weak administrative data systems, yet there was no
framework to incorporate them into national, regional and
global estimates. At the same time, survey-based data are
incomplete, as they tend to be infrequent and subject to
survey bias and sampling and non-sampling errors. Still,
the two sources can complement each other. A 2005 report
recognized that ‘some sort of composite approach may be
needed for estimating time series and producing estimates
for the most recent year’ (UIS and UNICEF, 2005).
It took another 15 years before this methodological
challenge was addressed. In 2022, the UNESCO Institute
for Statistics (UIS) and the Global Education Monitoring
(GEM) Report developed a new cohort-based model
that estimates out-of-school rates and numbers for
all countries with available data, combining multiple
data sources (UIS and GEM Report, 2022). The model
mirrors the natural progression of students through a
school cycle. Data from administrative and survey-based
sources are reconciled, recognizing the fundamental
differences in how the respective data are generated,
while sharing information about bias and variance across

countries. Similar approaches have been used by the
global health and demographic community to estimate
under-5 mortality (Alkema and New, 2014), maternal
mortality (Alkema et al., 2016) and sex-ratios at birth
(Chao et al., 2021). The model results are published on the
Visualizing Indicators of Education for the World (VIEW)
website (Box 12.1).

Using the new model, the global out-of-school population
of primary and secondary school age was estimated at
244 million in 2021, only 9 million less than in 2015. This
change corresponds to a slow decline of the out-of-school
rate from 17.3% in 2015 to 15.9% in 2021, or just over
0.2 percentage points per year. By education level,
out-of-school rates in 2021 stood at 9% for primary

The Visualizing Indicators of Education for the World (VIEW) website is accessible at: https://educationestimates.org/. It was launched in December 2021 to present the results of the completion rate
estimation model (Box 12.2). It was expanded in September 2022 with the results of the out-of-school
rate model produced by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS ) and the Global Education Monitoring
(GEM) Report. Its objective is to showcase the rationale for an estimation model for these two flagship
indicators and help countries reflect on the quality of their data.

Individual pages present specific results by education level, country, region and income group for each of the two indicators. The website
also allows users to explore details of the out-of-school rate model by plotting age-specific estimates (Figure 12.2). The left panel
plots the observed data series, with each age assigned a unique colour and each data source a unique marker. The right panel plots the
estimated age-specific out-of-school rate series. Further options from a drop-down menu allow users to look at the results by age, year
and cohort (e.g. the out-of-school path of those who were of school entry age in 2000).

The UIS still reports official completion and out-of-school rates by country. But the Technical Cooperation Group on Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 4 indicators has approved the use of the model’s results on two occasions: first, to report country income group,
regional and global averages; second, to report national values of out-of-school rates for countries that have not reported administrative
data during the last five years (UIS, 2022c).

school-age children, 14% for lower secondary school-age
adolescents and 30% for upper secondary school-age
youth.
Out-of-school rates have stagnated in Eastern and
South-eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean,
and sub-Saharan Africa but have declined in Central and
Southern Asia (from 23% to 20%) and in Northern Africa and
Western Asia (from 17% to 13%). Sub-Saharan Africa is a
unique case because the decrease in its out-of-school rate
has occurred while the absolute number of out-of-school
children has increased. Since 2015, the region’s
out-of-school rate has declined by just 0.1 percentage
points per year while its out-of-school population
grew by 12 million. Consequently, sub-Saharan Africa’s
out-of-school rate (29%) remains 10 percentage points
greater than in any other region. This is the result of rapid
demographic growth, which saw the school-age population
grow by 50 million in the 6 years between 2015 and
2021 (Figure 12.1).
The cohort structure of the model is well-designed
to capture long-term stable trends. It estimates
out-of-school rates for 187 countries and territories,
with only a handful not being covered, such as Eritrea and
Somalia (Box 12.3), although the margin of error is large in
many countries for which only survey data are available,
such as Angola or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Not only were education systems damaged by
school closures, their monitoring mechanisms
were, too

However, the model is less well-suited to capture
sudden departures from such trends. Events of this
kind are relatively rare in education systems, but the
COVID-19 pandemic presented just such a case. Therefore,
to understand whether school closures had a negative
impact on enrolment, it is necessary to analyse short-term
changes in administrative data. Unfortunately, not only
were education systems damaged by school closures, their
monitoring mechanisms were, too. By the time of the most
recent UIS release in March 2023, just 27% of countries

215

C H A P T E R 1 2 • P rimary and secondary education

had reported enrolment data in primary and secondary
education in 2019 and 2021. Even where data exist,
they can sometimes be difficult to interpret. It is unclear
whether an increase in the number of out-of-school
children is genuine or affected by particular disruptions
during the time of data collection.
One plausible assumption is that, if there is an impact on
enrolment, this is likely to have affected older students
more, especially the most disadvantaged, as their
attachment to school is more tenuous. In the face of
continuing uncertainty and with financial pressures adding
up, those students with the potential to earn income and
support their families would have been more likely to leave
school early. By contrast, the pandemic should have had a
lesser impact on younger children. In some countries, there
is evidence that dropout was higher at higher levels of
education, including in the Dominican Republic, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Zimbabwe.
But other countries, like Jordan and the Philippines,
followed the opposite pattern.
Drawing a general conclusion is difficult. The Philippines,
which had the longest school closure in this sample,
has reported a large increase in the primary out-of-school
rate (six percentage points) but a large decrease in the
upper secondary out-of-school rate (four percentage
points) between 2019 and 2021. India, which had an
average full school closure duration but one of the
longest partial school closure durations reported a
large decrease in the primary out-of-school rate
(seven percentage points); no data are reported for
secondary out-of-school rates. Excluding India and the
Philippines, the out-of-school population among the some
50 countries appears to have remained constant among
primary school-age children, to have declined among lower
secondary school-age adolescents (by 3.3%) and to have
increased among upper secondary school-age youth
(by 3.9% or just over half a million). On average, the longer
the duration of school closures, the higher the increase in
primary out-of-school rates: an increase of 1 percentage
point for every 22 weeks of full school closure. But this
is a weak association and does not hold for secondary
out-of-school rates (Figure 12.3).

B OX 12.2 :

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.1.2
SDG global indicator 4.1.2, the completion rate, has improved faster than the out-of-school rate (-1.4 percentage points across all school
age groups), according to the estimation model, which follows a similar methodology (Dharamshi et al., 2022) but draws exclusively on
household surveys and censuses. Globally, the completion rate increased between 2015 and 2021, from 85% to 87% in primary education
(2.1 percentage points), 74% to 77% in lower secondary education (2.8 percentage points) and 54% to 59% in upper secondary education
(4.9 percentage points). Sub-Saharan Africa remains well below the global average by more than 20 percentage points in primary
education (64%) and by almost 30 points in lower secondary (45%) and upper secondary education (27%).
This faster growth of completion relative to enrolment rates suggests that education development must not only be expanded, but also
be made more efficient through more timely enrolment and less repetition that enables more students to reach the end of each cycle.
While the SDG completion rate indicator is officially defined among those three to five years above graduation age (e.g. the primary
completion rate is calculated for 14- to 16-year-olds in education systems where primary school should officially be completed by
age 11), even this ‘timely’ completion rate may miss children and young people who reach the end of each cycle even later through a
combination of late enrolment and repetition. This is particularly the case in poorer countries. For instance, in low-income countries,
the timely completion rate was 56% in 2021 but the ‘ultimate’ completion rate was 69%, i.e. 13 percentage points higher (Figure 12.4).
Globally, this gap between timely and ultimate completion has fallen from 5.1 to 4.6 percentage points since 2015.
The gap between timely and ultimate completion declines in lower secondary (4.4 percentage points) and upper secondary education
(3.3 percentage points) as adolescents and youth are drawn into the labour market or, in the case of girls, pushed into marriage
and childbearing. But overall, it means that, globally, 92% ultimately complete primary, 81% lower secondary and 62% upper
secondary education.

In brief, high enrolment rates do not guarantee high completion rates. In Madagascar, the total net enrolment rate (i.e. 100% minus
the primary out-of-school rate) was 92% in 2014. But six years later, only 50% were completing primary school on time and 64% were
expected to eventually complete (Figure 12.5). The primary reason for this gap is high repetition: in Madagascar, 22% of primary school
students were repeating a grade. This is verified in all countries with a large gap between enrolment and completion that also have data
on repetition during this period, including Benin, Burundi, Chad and Uganda. Improving completion rates by 2030 requires overcoming the
twin challenge of late entry to school and repetition.

Historical data are needed to forecast the speed at which
countries will progress in the coming years. As part of the first
report on countries’ progress towards their national benchmarks,
countries’ progress given their starting points was analysed as
a basis for evaluating whether their recently observed progress
meets expectations (UIS and GEM Report, 2023). Progress tends
to be greater among countries whose existing completion rate
was around 50% and slower among those starting from a lower
or higher point. In the case of the upper secondary completion
rate, among countries that start with a completion rate value
between 60% and 70%, the average country in 2000–15 had an
annual increase of just under 1 percentage point. But the slowest
25% of countries improved by less than 0.7 percentage points
per year, while the fastest 25% of countries improved by almost
1.6 percentage points per year (Figure 12.6). As of 2023, the
upper secondary completion rate is projected to have reached
60% globally. If progress is at average past rates, then it will reach
66% by 2030; if it is at the level of the historically 25% fastest
country, then it will exceed 70%.

also most recently – by drought and famine episodes. Its public education system has likewise suffered a meltdown. In 2020, among
primary schools, just 3% were public and 39% were private but publicly supported; among secondary schools, 5% were public and
22% were private but publicly supported (Somalia Federal Government, 2022).
As the education system disintegrated, efforts to monitor education development in the country have struggled. To date, Somalia is the
only African country since records began in 1970 without any data point on thematic SDG indicator 4.1.3, the gross intake rate to the last
grade of primary education (which is a proxy of the primary completion rate).
The lack of a population census, from which to sample a representative set of households, challenges attempts to generalize findings
from household surveys, especially in the context of the most extreme mix of demographic conditions: nomadic populations, rapid
urbanization and some 1.1 million internally displaced people (World Bank, 2019) out of an estimated population of 17 million. Extreme
levels of insecurity make field research a high-risk activity and have resulted in some of the most vulnerable districts being excluded from
many surveys. Education questions have also been asked in inconsistent ways, which has prevented comparisons.
Nevertheless, data from various household surveys from the last 20 years can be pieced together to draw tentative conclusions. The
2006 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which was the second and last nationally representative of this family of surveys, provides a
baseline. It estimated the primary net attendance rate at 23%, ranging from less than 5% among the poorest fifth and 53% among the
richest fifth of households (and from 12% in rural to 41% in urban areas). The secondary net attendance rate was 7%, ranging from less
than 1% among the poorest three fifths to 22% for the richest fifth of households (and from 1% in rural areas to 14% in urban areas)
(UNICEF Somalia, 2006). Based on these data, the GEM Report team estimated that the primary completion rate was 24% (18% for girls)
and the upper secondary completion rate was 6% (1.5% for girls) in 2006.
Two surveys, close to nationally representative, have been carried out in recent years with the somewhat improved security situation.
But they provide contradictory estimates. In 2017, the second wave of the Somali High Frequency Survey in 2017 suggested that the
primary net attendance rate may have increased to 33%. It also estimated that the rate was lower for internally displaced people (25%)
and for nomads (10%) (World Bank, 2019). But the 2018–19 Somali Health and Demographic Survey provided a more pessimistic account,
suggesting that the primary net attendance rate was only 18% (20% for boys and 17% for girls). It also estimated an upper bound of the
primary completion rate for girls aged 15 to 19, when it suggested that 19% had ‘some levels of primary education’, which suggests that
there has been no education progress in the past 20 years (Somalia Directorate of National Statistics, 2020).
The latter account is also consistent with administrative data, which indicate that the net primary enrolment rate was 16% in
2020/21 (Somalia Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education, 2021). It can therefore be concluded that education development
has regressed since the 2006 baseline, with an estimated 13% to 17% of children reaching grades 6 to 8. It is estimated that 45% of
children aged 6 to 13 have never been to school (Somalia Federal Government, 2022). On the basis of this indicator, Somalia is one of the
three educationally least developed countries in the world, alongside Chad and South Sudan.
A particular difficulty in assessing the education situation is that a sizeable share of children in school attend Qur’anic schools. In
2018–19, among the two in five children aged 9 in school, half were in secular and half in Qur’anic schools (Somalia Federal Government,
2022), with many children attending both systems. Despite rudimentary conditions, these Islamic schools have offered a fallback when
formal schools collapsed in periods of crisis, due in part to their community ownership (Mohamed-Abdi, 2003; Moyi, 2012; Somalia
Federal Government, 2018). Nevertheless, they pose a challenge as they are not under the supervision of the education ministry
(Somalia Ministry of Education Culture and Higher Education, 2017).

LEARNING
Compared to access and completion statistics, analysis of
learning faces distinctive challenges. First, data on learning
outcomes are far less readily available. For instance, four
in five countries do not have any data for learning in
grades 2/3; roughly one in two countries do not have any
data for learning at the end of primary and lower secondary
education. Trend data are even more scarce: at most, 13 of
the 82 low- and lower-middle-income countries have
2 observations for reading at the end of primary education
since 2013, while other combinations of level and subject
have even fewer trend data points. Second, even when
trend data exist, the quality is insufficient to allow robust
assessments of change over time, despite significant
efforts by the UIS to align multiple assessments for
comparable measures of minimum proficiency
(UIS, 2023a). These measures include only some basic
skills: writing is not one of them, despite its importance.
It is also a skill that is potentially being affected by
technology (Focus 12.1).

Roughly one in two countries do not have any
data for learning at the end of primary and
lower secondary education

The data available show that low- and middle-income
countries are far from reaching universal minimum
proficiency. Of the 31 low- and lower-middle-income
countries for which there are data since 2019, only
Viet Nam has a majority of children achieving minimum
proficiency in both reading and mathematics at the end of
primary school. By contrast, in 18 of these countries, fewer
than 10% of children are reaching minimum proficiency in
reading and/or mathematics (Figure 12.7).

Combining the two SDG target 4.1 global indicators
on completion (4.1.2) and learning (4.1.1) into a single
measure is a succinct way to capture progress. It has been
recognized by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on
SDG Indicators as a form of disaggregation of global
indicator 4.1.1. The UIS and the GEM Report consider this
indicator as describing the percentage of children who are
‘prepared for the future’ and the UIS lists it as indicator
4.1.0. The indicator draws the attention of policymakers,
public opinion and the international community to the
percentage of an entire cohort in the population reaching
an education level (grade 3, end of primary and end
of lower secondary) and who are proficient in a given
subject (reading or mathematics), according to the global
minimum proficiency level. For instance, in Benin, 45% of
children achieved minimum proficiency in reading at the
end of primary school; but considering that one in three
children did not reach the end of primary school, only
30% of children in the primary school-age cohort achieved
minimum proficiency in reading.
An extension of this analysis shows the extent to which
children achieve proficiency in one or both subjects.
For example, only one in five children who achieved
minimum proficiency in at least one of the two subjects
achieved minimum proficiency in Chad and Congo,
but three in five did in Kenya and Madagascar. Overall,
even among the one in five children who reach the end
of primary in sub-Saharan Africa and achieve minimum
proficiency in reading or mathematics, only one in three
appear to achieve minimum proficiency in reading and
mathematics (Figure 12.8).

For every child to achieve minimum learning
proficiency by 2030, average annual progress
must be at least 2.7 percentage points

In order to predict progress in learning, past trends must
be considered. For every child to achieve minimum learning
proficiency by 2030, average annual progress must be at
least 2.7 percentage points. Piecing together the sparse
trend data, the average progress observed in reading
at the end of primary education in 2000–19 was just
0.4 percentage points (UIS, 2023b).
Disaggregated by country income group, low- and
lower-middle-income countries have improved (by
0.71 percentage points per year), while upper-middleand high-income countries have deteriorated (by
0.06 percentage points per year). One factor supporting

the faster increase in learning outcomes in poorer
countries is improved nutrition conditions, including
through school meals (Focus 12.2). These estimates are
important to inform discussions on the learning crisis but
must be used with extreme caution: 52% of children live
in countries where there are not enough data points to
estimate learning trends.
Another way to look at trends is to analyse the annual
change in the minimum proficiency level relative to the
countries’ starting points, as presented above for the
completion rate. Since 2011, the share of students at the
end of primary education with minimum proficiency in
reading has increased faster in poorer countries, which
began from a low starting point (Figure 12.9).
A similar distribution of progress characterizes proficiency
in mathematics at the end of primary education. Armenia
progressed well above the average – by 2.4 percentage
points per year – among the group of countries that
started with a share of students achieving minimum
proficiency between 50% and 75%. Türkiye progressed
above the average by even more – 3.3 percentage points
per year. In Türkiye, improvements in learning outcomes

have been associated with an increase in public education
expenditure, from 3.8% of GDP in 2010 to 4.4% in 2019,
alongside an increasing prioritization of learning outcomes
(Kitchen et al., 2019).
Estimates of slow growth in learning outcomes do not
even take into account COVID-19, which dealt a heavy blow
to education systems. Major questions remain about the
impact of COVID-19 on learning outcomes, not only its size
and unequal distribution but also whether it is short-term,
one-off or prolonged and will affect student learning
trajectories for years to come.
The first robust piece of cross-national evidence on the
impact of COVID-19 is the 2021 Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) on grade 4 students,
whose results were released in May 2023. Students from
57 mostly upper-middle- and high-income countries
participated. Progress relative to 2016 could be assessed
for 32 of these countries. In one sense, the 2021 PIRLS
confirms that COVID-19 had a negative impact on learning:
21 of 32 countries performed worse in 2021 than in 2016,
while 8 retained the same levels and 3 improved. But the
results could also be interpreted as not as bad as expected.
In 10 of the 21 countries whose achievement scores fell
between 2016 and 2021, the score had also decreased
between 2011 and 2016. Moreover, in absolute terms,

the average decline in the PIRLS score between 2016 and
2021 was eight points, which is about one fifth of what
children learn in a school year, a small impact given
the magnitude of the disruption. Still, it is a significant
consideration that these were wealthier countries with
many opportunities to maintain learning continuity for
most of their students.
Aside from PIRLS, and while anticipating the release
of other cross-national assessment data, several
country-specific studies have been published in the
last two years. However, they are not anchored to the
SDG 4 global proficiency level and comparability is further
hampered by these studies being carried out at different
times, levels and subjects. Nonetheless, these studies
suggest that COVID-19 took a toll on education systems.
This appears to be particularly true for poorer countries,
where schools were closed for longer periods, and distance
learning solutions were few and less effective than in
richer countries. As most studies come from high-income
countries (Hammerstein et al., 2021; Moscoviz and Evans,
2022; Patrinos et al., 2022), there is a concern that they
underestimate the impact in lower-income countries.
Country-specific studies measure learning loss using
different outcomes. Expressing the impact on the standard
deviations of learning outcomes (a measure of dispersion)
can offer a common scale and basis for comparison to
facilitate cross-country comparisons. These studies also
differ in their design. For example, observed learning
outcomes after students returned to school are compared
with expected outcomes based on past trends in some
studies but with actual observed outcomes before
COVID-19 in GDP. There is evidence that learning loss
was greater in primary than in secondary school, possibly
due to younger children’s weaker self-regulation skills
(Hammerstein et al., 2021). Thus, countries with primary
school evidence will likely yield higher learning loss
compared with country studies conducted in secondary
schools.
The data reveal significant variations in the size of
learning losses across countries and distance learning
modalities, with smaller effects in high-income countries
(Figure 12.10). The largest losses are observed in Brazil
and Mexico, where they exceeded 40% of a standard
deviation in learning outcomes, which is usually equated
with one year of education. There were also high impacts
measured in Cambodia and Malawi. However, the more
robust Monitoring Impacts on Learning Outcomes study
in six sub-Saharan African countries did not suggest any
major impact (UIS, 2022a), although caution is needed in
the interpretation: if learning levels in sub-Saharan Africa
were growing prior to the pandemic, then lack of progress
is a negative development.

As could be expected, learning losses have been greater
in countries with longer school disruptions, usually
lower-income countries (Figure 12.11a). The correlation
between learning loss and the number of weeks schools
were closed was –0.72 across countries. For example,
the size of the learning loss in Mexico was 61% of the
standard deviation during the 53 weeks schools were
closed, whereas students in Colombia experienced losses
of 6% during the 23 weeks schools were closed.
Learning losses were greater in countries where students
did not have access to the internet (Figure 12.11b).
The correlation between learning loss and internet access
was 0.48 across countries. In Malawi (but not in Uganda),
where at most 20% of the population has access to the
internet, the decline in learning was equivalent to at least
one year of schooling (>40%). In contrast, learning losses
were small or negligible in Australia, Denmark, Japan and
Spain, where 90% or more of the population has internet
access.

FOCUS 12.1: (HOW) DO WRITING TOOLS
AND TECHNIQUES MATTER?
Despite being part of the ‘three Rs’ of basic skills taught
in schools, writing – unlike reading and mathematics – is
rarely included in standardized learning assessments.
The 2019 Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study
assessment in Latin America, known by its Spanish
acronym, ERCE, included a module for assessing writing
skills, but the results, which showed that struggles with
writing are at least as widespread as with those reading,
were not widely disseminated. In the United States,
the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP) included a writing module in 2007, 2011 and
2017. The results from 2011 show a stark gender gap,
with 37% of girls performing at a proficient or advanced
level compared to 18% of boys. The 2017 results have
not been made available because preliminary analyses
revealed confounding factors affecting them: in particular,
the writing task used to be a pen and paper task, but was
moved to laptops for the 2011 assessment and then to
tablets in 2017.
The challenges presented by the choice of writing
technology is a clear reminder that writing has a material
dimension that cannot be separated from technology,
whether it is writing on a slate with chalk or writing on a
tablet with a stylus. Writing is, in and of itself, technology
(Haas, 2013). Creating a visual mark for others to read has
a history spanning millennia, starting with drawing in the
sand with toes, fingers or a stick. Other writing surfaces
and instruments have included papyrus, clay, ink applied
with quills and mechanical typewriters.

Writing has a material dimension that cannot
be separated from technology
Technology also has a role to play in writing, from
the banal, such as automatic spell-checking, to the
less tangible, such as enabling online collaborative
critique. Assistive technologies are also key for writing,
even if they tend to blur the line between writing and
speaking: cheek-controlled virtual keyboards (Lange,
2011) may count as writing but are a stepping stone for
text-to-speech synthesis. Conversely, even the relatively
well-established technology of speech-to-text conversion
has so far not diminished the continuing reliance on
mechanical writing in classrooms, although this may
change in the future. In a survey in Sweden, more than a
third of teachers reported using speech-to-text technology
to help writing instruction with all their students, not just
the ones needing assistance, ‘once or several times’ per
week (Fälth and Selenius, 2022).
But technology also has a role to play in the physical act
of writing. Two technologies predominate: pens, pencils
and paper on the one hand and screens and keyboards
on the other. Less clear is how each shapes language
performance and learning. A variety of studies shows that
each technology may have learning benefits.
Multisensory learning (Shams and Seitz, 2008) might
be one of the reasons explaining experimental research
showing higher learning gains in handwriting (Vasylets
and Marín, 2022) or the retention of notes taken (Mueller
and Oppenheimer, 2014). Stimulation in the reading
brain circuitry of 5-year-olds was found when they were
handwriting but not when they were typing (Lee et al.,
2022). A recent review documents evidence (partly from
neuroimaging) on the benefits of handwriting, notably
including with digital pens, in terms of writing letters
and words as well as reading (Vasylets and Marín, 2022).
One hypothesis is that the variability in handwriting
provides a stimulus beneficial for learning.
By contrast, the greater amount of movement involved
in typing, in turn, offers kinaesthetic learning benefits
of its own (Askvik et al., 2020). However, differences
in alphabet matter. In Chinese language learning,
for instance, handwriting benefited learners’ orthography
and orthography-semantic mapping, while typing
showed an advantage in phonography recognition and
phonology-orthographic mapping (Lyu et al., 2021).

12

Recent writing research has provided evidence
that typing might favour writing processes and
performance
Another question is whether the choice of writing
technology impacts the style and literary quality of the
writing. As linear finger movements are less demanding
of motor skills, learners can reach an ‘automatic’ level
faster when typing, leaving more time to think about
higher-level features of what they want to write (Trubek,
2016). While some true- and quasi-experimental evidence
does point in the direction of handwriting making better
writers (Santangelo and Graham, 2016), recent writing
research has provided evidence that typing might favour
writing processes and performance (Vasylets and Marín,
2022). A meta-analysis found that handwriting and
keyboarding fluency were significantly related, and both
make for better writers (Feng et al., 2019). A study of
Norwegian grade 1 students found no difference between
texts written with pen on paper or touch-typed on a
tablet (Spilling et al., 2021). A small-scale qualitative
study suggested that students, especially reluctant

writers, were more motivated to write longer texts when
typing (Rønningsbakk, 2022). Indeed, offering typing
as an alternative is a well-established accommodation
in response to certain learning or functional difficulties
(Freeman et al., 2005).
Ultimately, in their daily lives outside of school, young
people tend to use different writing technologies
depending on their subjective advantages and
disadvantages in a given context (Farinosi et al., 2016).
More important than the choice between them may be the
proficiency in the chosen technique. When handwriting
is used, better handwriting is associated with higher text
quality (Limpo et al., 2017; Skar et al., 2021) and academic
success (McCarroll and Fletcher, 2017). Similarly, without
the ability to touch-type, in other words, type without
looking at the keys, typing is not necessarily faster than
handwriting (Weigelt-Marom and Weintraub, 2018)
and the quality of texts written on a computer suffers
(Weerdenburg et al., 2019). Students in grade 8 at schools
that required better keyboarding skills scored higher in the
NAEP writing task.
Detailed data from the NAEP on the writing habits and
performance of grade 8 students in the United States
show that both students who report writing their school
assignments by hand more frequently and those who
use a computer more frequently score higher writing
scores (Figure 12.12). The same is true of students
whose teachers encourage them to use a mixed approach
of editing and finishing handwritten early drafts on a
computer.
Whether typing, handwriting or using a combination of
the two, students always had higher proficiency levels
when carrying out writing assignments more often.
What seems to matter most is simply performing writing
assignments frequently, by any means. It seems then that,
as handwriting and typing are not mutually exclusive in real
life, both have a place in the classroom.

FOCUS 12.2: HEALTHY SCHOOL
MEALS ARE KEY TO UNIVERSAL
EDUCATION AND LEARNING
Hungry children learn poorly. School feeding can play a
key role in supporting cognitive performance. Evidence
of the positive effects of school feeding on the health
and physical development of children, as well as their
schooling, is confirmed by systematic reviews
(Destaw et al., 2022; Kristjansson et al., 2007;
D. Wang et al., 2021). This includes the benefits that India’s
midday meal scheme – the world’s largest programme –
brings to learning (Chakraborty and Jayaraman, 2019),

12

Even countries that have low capacity or struggle to
implement teacher management or pedagogical reforms
have successfully implemented large-scale school feeding
programmes (Beeharry, 2021); their positive effects
are relatively robust even for programmes with weak
implementation. Unlike many interventions that require
highly skilled technical staff or make large demands on
teachers, school feeding tends to remain effective when
scaled up (Crawfurd et al., 2022).
There is a pressing need for further improvement: an
estimated one in three children lacks access to healthy
food (Cupertino et al., 2022). Some 73 million children
in low- and middle-income countries live in extreme
poverty with significant nutrition deficits (Drake et al.,
2020). In sub-Saharan Africa, 32% of children, or almost
one in three, are affected by stunting. In Central and
Southern Asia, 14% of children are affected by wasting
(United Nations, 2022). At the same time, low- and
middle-income countries are home to about 40 million
overweight young children under 5 and 120 million children
and adolescents who are obese. Hunger, malnutrition and
obesity add up to a triple burden, and providing balanced
meals at schools is an important part of relieving it.
Almost every country implements some kind of school
feeding programme (Chakrabarti et al., 2021). In 2020,
school feeding programmes reached 388 million,
or about one in two schoolchildren (WFP, 2020).
Unfortunately, the coverage is lowest in low-income
countries (Figure 12.13). Whereas most programmes in
upper-middle-income countries reach the majority of
children, more narrowly targeted programmes are more
commonplace in low- and lower-middle-income countries,
those countries with the greatest need.

Lower middle income

Feeding children at school, especially without charging
families (Chapter 22), serves as a significant attendance
incentive for disadvantaged households. If designed well,
large-scale school feeding programmes can also provide
local employment opportunities, including to farmers.
Strong efforts were made to continue operating school
feeding programmes even while schools themselves were
closed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic
(Borkowski et al., 2021), highlighting the importance of
school feeding in emergencies.

cost–benefit analysis across 14 low- and middle-income
countries, the education returns alone amounted to the
equivalent of USD 156 billion, a tenfold return on its cost of
USD 11 billion (Verguet et al., 2020).

School feeding programmes face many challenges. When
poorly designed, they can exacerbate poor children’s
experience of exclusion (O’Connell et al., 2022). School
meals have only a limited effect on malnutrition if they are
not sufficiently nutritious (H. Wang et al., 2020). Not all
foodstuffs are equally nutritious, nor are all combinations
of nutrients equally valuable for growing children. At the
same time, food ingredients differ in their seasonal
availability, nutrient density and price. With poor regulation
and cost cutting, many countries’ programmes are using
more ultra-processed foods. In the United Kingdom,
secondary school children get almost 80% of their lunch
calories from them. The share of such food is far too high
in school meals, although packed lunches children bring
from home tend to be even worse in terms of nutrition
(Parnham et al., 2022).

With poor regulation and cost cutting, many
countries’ programmes are using more ultraprocessed foods
Modern nutrition science provides guidance on combining
foods in meals that offer variety and a cost-efficient
way to growing children’s calorie and nutritional needs.
The most promising approach is to fortify staples that
are routinely consumed by most people. Nutritional
considerations are a critical part of the school feeding
process, but 23 low- and middle-income countries have
not published official nutrition guidelines for school meals
(Aliyar et al., 2015; FAO, 2019).
The Home Grown School Feeding initiative aims to
integrate school feeding with agricultural development and
poverty reduction. Home-grown school feeding aims to
connect local smallholder or family farmers to schools and
school communities. Farmers benefit from a predictable
buyer and the opportunity for greater investment,
and food gets transported over shorter distances, resulting
in multiple sustainable development gains. Home-grown
school feeding is currently supported in 46 countries by
the World Food Programme with technical support and a
resource framework (WFP, 2023), while other countries
have similar multisectoral schemes under national
ownership.
The integration of smallholders and schools into local
food supply chains can be facilitated by the judicious
use of technology, such as in transportation, tagging
and monitoring logistics, and increasing transparency.
For example, artificial intelligence-based routing and

227

C H A P T E R 1 2 • P rimary and secondary education

scheduling was used to optimize the delivery of school
meals using school buses during COVID-19 school closures
in the United States (Smith et al., 2020).
Logistics are also important for hygiene. Almost a third of
the global population is affected annually by foodborne
illnesses (Cupertino et al., 2022). The lack of cold-chain
technology limits the use of fish in several countries,
including Angola, Honduras, Peru and even in island states
such as Sao Tome and Principe (Ahern et al., 2021). Where
home-grown school food programmes use produce from
non-commercial family farms, they must be monitored
for compliance with hygiene practices, as contamination
of meat and fish is not uncommon, as documented,
for instance, in Brazil (de Rosso et al., 2021).
Many schools lack basic infrastructure, including for
cooking. Across school feeding programmes in low- and
middle-income countries, only some 40% of schools
hosting the programmes have kitchens. A lack of suitable
infrastructure at schools can be overcome either by
centralized preparation of meals that are then distributed
to schools or by providing dry snacks such as biscuits.
Nutritious meals made from locally sourced, fresh
ingredients can be prepared in large central kitchens
implementing recognized food safety standards.
A centralized model has been successfully applied by
the award-winning initiative Food4Education in Kenya
(Food4Education, 2023), which has four kitchens and the
capacity to cater to up to 30,000 children every day. At the
schools, the subsidized price for a meal is charged to a
tap-to-pay wristband that families can recharge using
mobile payment systems.
Food is directly or indirectly responsible for a substantial
part of global carbon emissions, both food eaten and
food wasted. School food that goes to waste is both an
unnecessary environmental burden and missed nutrition
(Liu et al., 2016). Especially for children, food must be made
palatable. A study in Ghana showed that disadvantaged
children with no other options might choose to go hungry
if they dislike the school food being served (Mohammed,
2021). Aligning with the local food culture is also important
to encourage children to develop cooking skills at school
(Cupertino et al., 2022). Eating food, even good food, does
not necessarily educate learners about food the way
food preparation might (Andersen et al., 2017). Since at
least 2006, the World Health Organization framework for
addressing nutrition-related health problems in the school
environment has adopted a holistic view beyond school
feeding itself to include nutrition policy, awareness-raising
and training, and a curriculum and school environment
supportive of good nutrition (Cupertino et al., 2022).

KE Y MESSAGES
The world early childhood education participation rate remained stable at about 75% between 2015 and 2020. The
largest increases, of about four percentage points each, took place in sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa and
Western Asia, the two regions that had the lowest baseline values.

The COVID-19 pandemic set progress back in some countries. Participation rates dropped by about 20 percentage
points in selected lower-middle- (Nepal and Philippines), upper-middle- (Albania and Dominican Republic) and highincome countries (Oman and Uruguay).
The average enrolment rate in countries that do not offer any free pre-primary education is 68%, compared with
78% among those that guarantee one and 83% among those that guarantee at least two years of free pre-primary
education.
Countries where households have at least three books at home tend to have higher shares of children experiencing
positive and stimulating home environments. In nearly 40 countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, over
90% of children have fewer than three books at home.
Active play outdoors is an essential element of early childhood education, but a study of 28 countries showed that
too few children reached high levels of physical activity. The lack of such activity may be a bigger concern in richer
and urban contexts, but the rapid advent of technology and long times spent watching screens are turning it into a
global policy concern.

ustainable Development Goal (SDG) target
4.2 emphasizes the importance of early childhood
development. It focuses on monitoring regulations, home
environments and early childhood care and education
(ECCE) participation, even though several other factors play
an important role, including the type and quality of ECCE
provision (Focus 13.1).

Many countries guarantee at least one year of free
pre-primary education, but only about one quarter make
it compulsory

Thematic indicator 4.2.5 measures the number of years of
free and compulsory pre-primary education guaranteed in
legal frameworks. About half of countries do not offer free
provision of pre-primary education, and three quarters
of countries do not make it compulsory (Figure 13.1).
In 2022, 88 out of 186 countries with available data still
did not have any legislation committing to either free or
compulsory pre-primary education.

Countries that guarantee free and compulsory pre-primary
education tend to have considerably higher enrolment
rates. The average enrolment rate for children one year
younger than the official primary school entry age in
countries that do not offer any free pre-primary education
is 68%, compared to 78% among those that guarantee one
year free and 83% among those that guarantee at least
two years (Figure 13.2). Making pre-primary education
compulsory has an even stronger association with
education participation. The average enrolment increases
from 69% in countries where it is not compulsory to
89% in countries where one year is compulsory and 92% in
countries where at least two years are compulsory.

Making pre-primary education compulsory has
an even stronger association with education
participation
Individual countries’ trajectories help confirm the positive
effect that legal frameworks can have on pre-primary
education. In Azerbaijan, for example, the implementation

Progress has been slow and has slowed down even
further since 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, 10 countries
increased the number of years of free, and 18 countries
of compulsory, pre-primary education. Since 2015,
when countries committed to make at least one year
of pre-primary education free and compulsory, another
13 countries increased the number of years of free
and 5 countries of compulsory pre-primary education.
Azerbaijan moved from zero to five years of free
pre-primary education between 2015 and 2018 and
Latvia now guarantees six years of free and two years of
compulsory pre-primary education.

of compulsory and then free pre-primary education was
associated with significant increases in enrolment rates
for children one year younger than the official primary
entry age (Figure 13.3a). In Uzbekistan, the introduction
of two years of free and compulsory pre-primary
education in 2017 led to the enrolment rate doubling in
the following five years. The strength of impact, however,
always depends on how countries implement and enforce
legislation: in some countries, including for example Kenya
and Nigeria, parents are asked to pay hidden fees for
uniforms, examinations and textbooks, or administrative
costs despite legal guarantees of free education
(Cinnamon, 2022; Malala Fund, 2021).

13

Legal guarantees can also help improve equity in access
to pre-primary education. In Ecuador, where enrolment
rates have been relatively high for the past 15 years,
a 2008 constitutional reform that increased free and
compulsory pre-primary education from 1 to 3 years is
associated with an improvement in the wealth parity
index – a measure of the gap in attendance between
the richest and the poorest children (Ecuador Republic,
2008). Before 2008, the richest children were about
25% more likely to attend pre-primary education than the
poorest children, a gap which has more than halved since
2010 (Figure 13.3b).

In 2007, Ghana introduced a series of early childhood
education policies, including guaranteeing two years of
free and compulsory pre-primary education. Given the
prevalence of non-state providers, the government also
introduced a limit to the level of tuition and other fees
charged by private institutions (Pesando et al., 2020). Since
then, the net attendance rate for children one year younger
than the official primary entry age has been steadily
increasing, and the wealth parity index has improved
considerably for every 100 of the richest children enrolled,
from 50 of the poorest children enrolled in 2006 to
74 enrolled in 2018 (Figure 13.3b).

Consequently, the lack of free and compulsory
pre-primary education legislation risks undermining
countries’ SDG 4 benchmarks for 2025 and 2030. In total,
117 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia, have set a target
for increasing early childhood education participation but
without having legislation to make pre-primary education
compulsory. For example, Kenya has set a target of over
80% enrolment for children one year younger than the
official primary entry age by 2025, and Pakistan a target of
95%, even though neither of these countries offer free or
compulsory pre-primary education (UNESCO, 2023).

At the height of preschool and kindergarten
closures in early April 2020, more than
180 million children had their pre-primary
schooling disrupted
The COVID-19 pandemic may have set progress back in
some countries, at least in the short term. At the height of

preschool and kindergarten closures in early April 2020,
more than 180 million children had their pre-primary
schooling disrupted (Nugroho et al., 2021). On average,
preschools were closed for 78 days in 2020, ranging
from 46 days in high-income countries to 122 days in
lower-middle-income countries (UNESCO et al., 2021).
Younger children lost more instruction days than primary
and secondary students, and they were also less likely to
have access to remote learning opportunities
(Nugroho et al., 2021).
This disruption caused sharp declines in pre-primary
participation in many countries (Figure 13.4). In some,
the impact was already notable in 2020 and in others in
2021. This was likely because of when student counts were
conducted (before or after the peak COVID-19 closures)
and the duration of school closures. In the Philippines,
for example, enrolment dropped considerably between
2019 and 2020 – from 86% to 66% – and remained equally
low in 2021. In Oman, enrolment remained stable in
2020 but dropped by 27% between 2020 and 2021.

This fall in participation is likely to exacerbate
inequality between and within countries. Low- and
lower-middle-income countries kept institutions closed for
longer, and disadvantaged children were more likely not
to be sent to preschool as families experiencing income
losses during the pandemic are believed to have prioritized
the education of older children (Al-Samarrai et al., 2020).
Absence from preschool comes with a significant impact
on children’s learning, social and cognitive stimulation
(Yoshikawa et al., 2020): one study estimated that the
closures between March 2020 and February 2021
alone would result in 11 million more children being
developmentally off track (McCoy et al., 2021).
The importance of children’s overall development is
reflected in global indicator 4.2.1, i.e. the proportion of
children under 5 years of age who are developmentally
on track in health, learning and psychosocial well-being.
Various steps have been taken to improve how
this indicator is monitored. Since 2015, UNICEF has
systematically reviewed available tools; identified items
that measure child development; carried out cognitive
tests; and piloted draft questions and administrative
procedures. The new monitoring tool, the Early Childhood
Development Index 2030 (ECDI2030), has broader and
more comprehensive content coverage than the original
Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI). It contains
20 questions in 3 interrelated domains: learning,

psychosocial well-being and health (UNICEF, 2022).
In March 2020, the United Nations Statistical Commission
approved the ECDI2030 to be implemented in future
rounds of UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
(MICS) and it has also been included in the Demographic
and Health Surveys and in national data collections
(Petrowski et al., 2022).
So far, the results from using the ECDI2030 are only
available for a few countries. Data from Nigeria and
Viet Nam serve as an example of the difference between
the old and the new ECDI measures. In both countries,
fewer children are considered to be developmentally on
track using the ECDI2030 than with the previous ECDI
measure. In Nigeria, the share of children developmentally
on track using the previous ECDI measure in 2016/17 was
14 percentage points higher than the measure using the
ECDI2030 in 2021. In Viet Nam, it was 11 percentage points
higher. These results are to be expected given the larger
number of developmental subdomains covered in the new
module. Nevertheless, as was the case with previous ECDI
results (UNESCO, 2021), the new ECDI2030 continues
to highlight significant inequality in development across
children of different backgrounds. In Nigeria, while 79% of
children who have a mother with tertiary education were
developmentally on track, the same was true for only
31% of those whose mother has not completed primary
education (Figure 13.5).

Target 4.2 also recognizes that much of children’s
development happens at home, where children first learn
to socialize, manipulate objects and materials, develop
language, and explore the world around them. Hence,
thematic indicator 4.2.3 examines whether children
experience a positive and stimulating home environment
in the form of adults’ engagement in a range of activities:
reading or looking at picture books; telling stories; singing
songs; taking children outside the home; playing; and
naming, counting and/or drawing. Such parenting practices
are all associated with better developmental outcomes
(Fletcher and Reese, 2005; UNESCO, 2021).
Children from poorer households are consistently less
likely to experience positive adult engagement at home.
One reason for this pattern is that poverty increases
parents’ stress and constrains their time, which is instead

Children from poorer households are
consistently less likely to experience positive
adult engagement at home
spent on labour and livelihood challenges (UNESCO, 2020;
Verdisco et al., 2016). Another reason may be a lack of
materials, such as children’s books and toys. Countries
where children are more likely to have at least three
children’s books at home also tend to have higher shares
of children experiencing positive and stimulating home
environments (Figure 13.6). In nearly 40 countries, many of
which are in sub-Saharan Africa, over 90% of children have
fewer than three children’s books at home (UNICEF, 2021).

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.2.2
Trends for the global indicator 4.2.2, the percentage of children one year younger than the official primary entry age who participate in
organized learning programmes, highlight very slow progress since 2015. Globally, the participation rate has remained stable at about
75% between 2015 and 2020. The largest increases, of about four percentage points each, have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa
and Northern Africa and Western Asia, the two regions with the lowest baseline values (Figure 13.7). But progress must accelerate
considerably if countries are to reach the targets set for 2025 and 2030, as expressed in the national SDG 4 benchmarking process
(UNESCO, 2023). In sub-Saharan Africa, participation increased by an average of 0.7 percentage points per year between 2015 and 2020;
however, the rates must grow four times faster, or by 2.8 percentage points per year, to reach the region’s 2025 benchmark – or even
faster if COVID-19 is found to have had a long-term impact.
The 2023 SDG 4 Scorecard monitored individual countries’ progress towards achieving their national benchmarks, taking into account
their starting points and the progress made between 2000 and 2015. Overall, high-income countries are more likely to be classified
as either having achieved, or having a very high probability (over 75%) of achieving their 2025 national benchmark. Nevertheless,
there are 15 low- and lower-middle-income countries that are on track to achieve their benchmarks: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Bhutan,
Cambodia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Vanuatu and Viet Nam
(UNESCO, 2023).

FOCUS 13.1: ACTIVE PLAY OUTDOORS
IS MISSING FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD
EDUCATION

Nature-based education amplifies both the benefits and
the risks of outdoor play. It can provide opportunities for
honing scientific skills, including observation, classification
and prediction (Yanagihara, 2019), as well as general skills,
including problem-solving, critical thinking, leadership,
teamwork and communication (Kuo et al., 2019). Even
coding can be introduced in this setting, without reference
to or handling of electronic devices (Bell and Vahrenhold,
2018; McLennan, 2020; Polat and Yilmaz, 2022;
Saxena et al., 2020; Singhal, 2022). A systematic review
similarly concluded that nature experiences show
promise for increasing content knowledge and insights
into scientific methodologies (Schilhab, 2021). Forest
kindergartens, for instance, are daily outdoor educational
programmes with limited or no indoor facilities. Children
spend most of their time outside and the curriculum is
based on their outdoor activities (Larimore, 2016).

The Education 2030 Framework for Action does not
reference play as an essential element of SDG 4.
It recognizes that young children ‘engage in intensive
meaning-making of the self and surrounding world’ but
makes no reference to their interaction with the natural
world. But while active play outdoors is an essential
element of early childhood education, a global study of
unstructured play and/or time outdoors showed that
children and adolescents did not reach high levels of
physical activity in any country (Figure 13.8). The lack of
such activity may be a bigger concern in richer and urban
contexts, but the rapid advent of technology and lengthy
screen time is turning it into a global policy concern.

Nature-based education amplifies both the
benefits and the risks of outdoor play
Some studies suggest that the calmness of outdoor
activity is beneficial, specifically for disadvantaged children
(Kim et al., 2012; Kuo and Taylor, 2004; Yıldırım and
Akamca, 2017). Recognizing unconventional forms of early
childhood education may reduce barriers to indigenous
communities’ participation. In New Zealand, the bicultural
Te Whāriki curriculum, introduced in 1996 and updated in
2017, has required teachers to incorporate Māori ways of
appreciating and connecting with the natural environment
into their teaching, well before the model of forest
kindergartens arrived in the country (Masters and Grogan,
2018). Moreover, alternative home-grown initiatives, also
reflecting Māori thinking, have achieved considerable
scale – the Enviroschools, for instance, of which there
are 1,000 at school level and 200 at early childhood level
(Alcock and Ritchie, 2018). In New Zealand and elsewhere,
it has long been recommended to recognize traditional
teaching of plant lore and outdoor survival skills, such as by
the San in Namibia, as a form of early childhood education
(Haraseb, 2011).
The role that nature-based early childhood education
might play in low- and middle-income countries is
ambiguous. By making use of what is found in the
environment, it costs less than modern preschools with
rent and equipment costs. However, it requires an outdoor
space that must be both accessible and reasonably safe,
which is a luxury in many contexts.
Risks to safety may come from exposure to inclement
weather, wild animals or toxic plants. However, a study of
the frequency, types and causes of injuries in forest and
conventional kindergartens in Japan found injuries were
not appreciably higher in forest settings than in school
settings (Imanishi et al., 2018), even though some types –
such as burns and tick bites – were specific to them.
Similar findings were reported in Czechia
(Michek et al., 2015).

No authoritative data exist on nature-based early
childhood education programmes as they are a niche
service. However, studies in selected high-income
countries suggest that their numbers are increasing.
In Norway, there are 356 nature kindergartens (Alme,
2021), making up some 6% of the 5,788 kindergartens
in the country. There are more than 500 in Denmark,
where the wave of nature kindergartens originated in
the late 20th century (Riis, 2023). There were 120 such
organizations in Czechia by 2014, about 2,000 in Germany
(Bundesverband der Natur- und Waldkindergärten,
2023), up from ‘over 300’ reported in 2004 (Kiener,
2004), and 180 in Sweden (Michek et al., 2015). The North
American Association for Environmental Education
estimates at least 585 nature-based preschools in the
United States, up from fewer than 25 in 2010 (Natural
Start Alliance, 2020). And, in Japan, there were reportedly
more than 100 forest kindergartens as of 2014
(Imamura, 2014).
Regulatory frameworks do not fit easily with this growing
trend. Some countries, including Czechia and Germany,
have adopted specific regulations to define and recognize
forest kindergartens (Klauer, 2016). In Scotland,
United Kingdom, the government adopted a Play Strategy
and changed the role of regulators to help providers
improve children’s experiences of outdoor play (Mathias,
2018). But mainstream regulations mostly presume
an indoor facility, for instance, including a minimum
surface area per child or a minimum number of toilets.
By definition, forest kindergartens, especially in their
purest form, cannot meet such requirements.
In Australia, nature-based early childhood education
is limited to four hours per day because the regulatory
requirements for full-time centres cannot be met
(Christiansen et al., 2018). An alternative solution has been
to run programmes part-time and under other frameworks
than early childhood education. In the Republic of Korea,
many centres are operated by the Korea Forest Service
for instance, rather than education authorities, as ‘infant
forest experience centres’, thereby avoiding regulatory
constraints on licensed kindergartens
(Jeon et al., 2020).

Nature-based early childhood education is more often
an elite experience for already privileged families
(Perlman et al., 2020). In the United States, for example,
African-American children, Hispanic children, children
with special needs and children living in households
where English is not the primary language are all
underrepresented in these programmes
(Natural Start Alliance, 2017).

KE Y MESSAGES
For adults aged 25 to 54, the median participation rate in formal and non-formal education and training across 115
countries with recent data is 3%, ranging from 2% in low- and lower-middle-income countries to 7% in high-income
countries.
In 57 mostly high-income countries with data for both 2015 and either 2020 or 2021, the median participation rate
declined by 10%, mostly as a result of COVID-19. For example, between 2019 and 2020, the rate fell from 23% to 15%
in France and from 15% to 6% in the United Kingdom.
Global enrolment in tertiary education grew over the previous decade, but at a slower pace after 2015: the gross
enrolment ratio increased from 29% in 2010 to 37% in 2015 and 40% in 2020.
In 2020, the tertiary gross enrolment ratio for women was 43% and that for men was 37%. Of the 146 countries with
data, 106 had a gap in favour of females and 30 a gap in favour of males. Among the latter, 22 are in sub-Saharan
Africa.
In contrast to tertiary education, the gender gap in technical-vocational education was smaller and tended to favour
males. Of the 146 countries with data, 40 had a sizeable gap in favour of males and just 3 in favour of females.
Micro-credentials’ flexibility and relatively low cost offer the potential to promote equity. However, this potential is
limited by the fact that they are generally not rewarded in the labour market as much as traditional degrees.

o indicator could ever capture global progress on
the very wide range of post-compulsory education
opportunities covered in Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) target 4.3. Global indicator 4.3.1 focuses on just
one angle: the participation rate of youth and adults in
formal and non-formal education and training in the
previous 12 months. As with all indicators under target 4.3,
the focus is on access rather than affordability, quality and
equity (except gender inequality).

F I G U R E 14. 1:

The median adult participation rate in formal and
non-formal education and training is 3%

For adults aged 25–54, the median participation rate
in formal and non-formal education and training across
115 countries with recent data is 3% (Figure 14.1), ranging
from 2% in low- and lower-middle-income countries
to 3% in upper-middle-income countries and 7% in
high-income countries.
In Europe, the median is 8%; all countries with participation
rates above 10% are in the region. This is despite the
fact that the reference period for education and training
questions in the European labour force surveys is the
last 4 weeks before the survey instead of the 12 months
originally intended by the indicator. Another specialized
survey, the Adult Education Survey, which is carried out
about every 5 years and has a 12-month reference period,
yields much higher participation rates. Overall, caution is
needed when comparing data for this indicator given the
different reference periods across surveys.
The data also show that, globally, there is gender parity
in participation rates, with males at 3.1% and females
at 3%. Of the 113 countries with data by sex, only six
have a gender gap of more than five percentage points,
and in all cases, it is in favour of females. All but one of
these are located in northern Europe (Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, Iceland and Sweden, which has the largest gap,
14 percentage points); the other country is the Dominican
Republic.
Education and training is meant not only to improve a
population’s skills for work, but also the value they can
derive from their employment. Cross-national data that
help assess the extent to which education and training
improve well-being come from the Comparative Panel File,
which compiles household surveys from seven countries:

While participation in formal education and training can
be measured by asking both providers and beneficiaries,
non-formal education and training opportunities can only
be estimated systematically by asking those who benefit
from them. The data that inform this indicator, therefore,
primarily come from labour force surveys compiled by the
International Labour Organization and analysed by the
UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).

Australia, Germany, the Republic of Korea,
the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the United Kingdom
and the United States. On average, workers who have
undertaken training are no more likely to express
satisfaction with their work or a sense of job security
in six of the seven countries. Only in the Republic of
Korea were those with training 18 percentage points
more likely to express high job satisfaction (50% vs 32%)
and 7 percentage points more likely to express a sense of
job security (91% vs 84%).
Indicator 4.3.2 is the gross enrolment ratio for tertiary
education. It divides the number of people enrolled in
tertiary education regardless of age by the number
of people within five years of the standard age for
upper-secondary completion (usually 19 to 23 years old).
However, the indicator does not account for differences
in the duration of programmes between countries
(for example, whether a bachelor’s degree typically takes
three or five years). Moreover, the indicator does not
distinguish between different levels of tertiary education.
For example, two countries with similar enrolment ratios
might have quite different profiles, with one having
far more people studying in short-cycle or long-cycle
programmes or even in postgraduate degrees (Box 14.2).
Global enrolment in tertiary education grew over the
previous decade, but at a slower pace after 2015: the gross
enrolment ratio increased from 29% in 2010 to 37% in 2015,

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.3.1
There are 57 countries for which there are data on
indicator 4.3.1 in both 2015 and either 2020 or 2021.
Compared to the general analysis, an even higher share of
countries are high-income (60% vs 35%), which means results
need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, the median
participation rate declined from 6.4% to 5.8%, or by 10% in this
five-year period (Figure 14.2). It appears that adult education
and training levels, at least in countries that experienced the
largest decline in relative terms, was negatively affected by
COVID-19, as the sharpest fall is observed in 2019–20.
For example, in just one year, the rate fell from 23% to 15% in
France and from 15% to 6% in the United Kingdom. The only
country where participation rates fell continuously and appear
unrelated to COVID-19 is Iceland (from 31% to 23%). Even
countries where participation rates rose in the five-year period
suffered a decline in 2019–20: in Ireland from 14% to 12% and
in Estonia from 23% to 20%.

Global enrolment in tertiary education grew
over the previous decade, but at a slower pace
after 2015

but only to 40% five years later. Gross enrolment ratios
range from below 1% in South Sudan to over 150%
in Greece, where many are still enrolled to maintain
certain social benefits even though they are not actually
attending. At the lower end, 16 countries have a female
gross enrolment ratio below 10%, all of which are in
sub-Saharan Africa except Afghanistan, even before the
Taliban government banned tertiary education for women.
In most countries, females are more likely than males to be
enrolled in tertiary education. In 2020, the gross enrolment
ratio for women was 43% compared to 37% for men.
Of the 146 countries with data, 106 have a gap in
favour of females and 30 – 22 of which are in
sub-Saharan Africa – have a gap in favour of males.
The higher the rate of tertiary enrolment, the more
likely there is to be a gap in favour of females. Of the
50 countries with the highest enrolment ratios, only the
Republic of Korea has a sizeable gap in favour of males,
compared to 47 countries with a sizeable gap in favour of
females (Figure 14.3).
Indicator 4.3.3, which measures the participation rate in
technical-vocational education among 15- to 24-year-olds,
regardless of whether they are at the secondary,
post-secondary non-tertiary or tertiary levels, shows
a contrasting situation. Unlike indicator 4.3.2, which
counts participation regardless of age, this indicator only
counts participation among youths in this particular age
range. In contrast to tertiary education, the gender gap
in technical-vocational education is smaller and tends to
favour males. Of the 146 countries with data, 40 have a
sizeable gap in favour of males (in excess of 3 percentage
points) in contrast to just 3 (Curaçao, Israel and Seychelles)
in favour of females. Across countries, participation in
technical-vocational programmes ranges from 0% to 36%.
The lowest participation rates (less than 10%) are found
primarily in the Caribbean, the Pacific and sub-Saharan
Africa. The highest rates (more than 25%) are found
almost exclusively in Europe, the exceptions being the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Seychelles, Singapore and
Uzbekistan.
COVID-19 may have posed even greater challenges to
technical-vocational education than to other types of
formal learning because its applied nature is, in many
contexts, difficult to emulate with the technology available.
For example, safety measures in Malaysia limited the
handling of tools and in-person practical assessments,
requiring educators to rely more on theoretical coursework
(Masrom et al., 2022). Colleges in the Philippines faced
such great challenges switching to large online classes that
the Commission on Higher Education suspended online
learning after three days of teaching (Toquero, 2020).

Studies of colleges in Kenya and South Africa report the
exacerbating impact of connectivity issues and a lack of
training and support in how to teach online, especially in
rural areas (Aina and Ogegbo, 2022; Karani and Waiganjo,
2022). In contrast, some systems successfully used their
existing technological capacity to shift online; for example,
Mexico’s Capacítate Para El Empleo (Train for Work) online
portal made hundreds of technical courses freely available
(Hoftijzer et al., 2020).

FOCUS 14.1: WILL MICRO-CREDENTIALS
CHALLENGE TRADITIONAL HIGHER
EDUCATION DEGREES?
Opportunities for skills development, including
sophisticated skills for highly paid technical positions,
are increasingly sought outside of traditional higher
education. Multiyear degrees are less attractive to
those who lack time, money or the inclination. Mutually
reinforcing trends in education and in employment,

243

such as fully online instruction, open-access learning
materials and skills-based hiring, have coalesced around
the concept of micro-credentials. Micro-credentials
are the ‘digital certification of assessed knowledge,
skills and competencies which is additional, alternate or
complementary to or a component of formal qualifications’
(Oliver, 2019). Micro-credentials can be issued by various
providers who may or may not be registered as tertiary
education institutions in a given country or may not even
be in the same country as the student. They are not taken
into account in international tertiary education statistics.
Micro-credentials are only ‘micro’ relative to traditional
degrees and not necessarily as short as the name may
suggest. A 2018 review of 450 micro-credentials offered
by some of the major online providers found the average
time to complete a course was 3 to 12 months, although
some courses took over 50 months to complete. Minimum
completion time ranged from 1 to 15 months. While some
courses only require a few hours per week and can easily

Postgraduate education participation has been growing more slowly than overall tertiary education
Tertiary education encompasses multiple levels. Countries vary greatly in the distribution between short-cycle (ISCED 5) and long-cycle
(ISCED 6) programmes. Less attention has been paid to postgraduate education programmes, i.e. master’s (ISCED 7) and doctoral
(ISCED 8) programmes. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) does not report separate enrolment rates for each level. However,
a look at the distribution of the student population between each level is indicative of whether the balance between different
levels has changed.
Among those in tertiary education, in the past decade there has been a slight decline in the proportion studying advanced degrees.
Overall, around 12% of students enrolled in tertiary education were pursuing master’s or doctoral-level degrees in 2020, down from
14% in 2012. The share ranges from 24% in Europe and Northern America to about 6% in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Eastern
and South-Eastern Asia. One partial explanation may be that higher-level or specialized skills are increasingly sought outside traditional
higher education, as evidenced by the growing popularity of micro-credentials (Focus 14.1).
The drop appears concentrated in upper-middle-income countries at the master’s level. Between 2012 and 2020, enrolment in master’s
courses as a proportion of all tertiary study almost halved, from 11% to 6%. By contrast, the proportion of tertiary students in those
countries who were at the doctoral level remained constant, at 1%, meaning that the shift in these countries was due to a greater
proportion of students pursuing bachelor’s degrees (Figure 14.4). Meanwhile, other parts of the world experienced very little change
over the same period. The two major features that continued to prevail during the 2010s are that advanced degrees took a greater share
of tertiary education students in high-income countries and that master’s students outnumbered doctoral students globally by a ratio
of about 8:1.

Micro-credentials allow specific skills to be acquired
on demand at any time and in any place. This meets
the needs of learners for flexibility and personalization
of learning opportunities that, ideally, can add up to
a higher-value qualification over time (Resei et al.,
2019). Students can learn vertically (i.e. a sequence of
increasingly advanced courses that build on each other),
horizontally (e.g. combinations that broaden information
and communication technology [ICT] professionals’
skills in a set of different programming tools) or in other
domains (e.g. engineers or other professionals acquiring
project management skills) (Cedefop, 2023). For instance,
while there is significant demand for job-specific science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills in
non-STEM occupations (Grinis, 2019), these skills often
do not require a full STEM degree and could be more
efficiently acquired by teaching them to those who already
possess the required non-STEM skills for the job.
The relatively low cost and short course duration lower
entry barriers. Flexibility of timing and sequencing is
also an advantage: it is possible to leave arbitrarily long
gaps between individual credentials, unlike traditional
degrees, where interruptions are typically subject to
strict rules. In the best case, micro-credentials support
self-regulated learning, whereby learners are active agents
who set their own goals and monitor and regulate their
progress. Working towards micro-credentials can remind
them of their progress to date and what gaps remain
(Gish-Lieberman et al., 2021). New technological skills
can be incorporated and certified long before they are
included in traditional degree curricula. Micro-credentials

245

therefore potentially serve not only credentialing but also
motivational and pedagogical functions
(Richard et al., 2020).
But critics say that micro-credentials may be harmful
or go against the very idea of university education.
Some are concerned by the fragmentation of knowledge
(Chakroun and Keevy, 2018). Short courses leading to a
narrow prespecified skill reduces the scope of curriculum
by packaging knowledge in small pieces (Cliff et al.,
2022). Further, micro-credentials may be only serving
professionals to receive visible certification for skills they
already have rather than to actually aid in their acquisition
(Kässi and Lehdonvirta, 2018).
The benefits of micro-credentials as part of the overall
tertiary education system are yet to be proven outside
of specific niches (Oliver, 2021). Large gaps remain in
academic research; most publications on the topic are
white papers and reports (Selvaratnam and Sankey, 2021).
While there was tremendous growth in enrolment in online
massive open online courses in 2020, many of which led
to micro-credentials, their sustainability remains unclear
(Cowie and Sakui, 2022).
Greater confidence and trust in micro-credentials are
undermined by the lack of common definitions, standards
and regulations. University and industry stakeholders
consider this the biggest barrier to the greater adoption
of micro-credentials (HolonIQ, 2021). Part of the
problem is that employers can struggle to assess the
credibility of credentials due to a lack of structured

information. The non-profit Credential Engine identified
1,076,000 unique credentials in the United States
alone, of which there were some 430,000 digital badges
(Credential Engine, 2022).
This situation is beginning to change, with major
governance stakeholders adopting explicit frameworks
for the integration of micro-credentials into national
and international education, qualifications and training
frameworks. Australia has already incorporated
micro-credentials into its national qualifications
framework, paving the way for their official recognition
(Pollard and Vincent, 2022). Following a consultation
process, the Malaysian Qualifications Authority in
2020 released a good practice guide for micro-credential
providers. Adherence to its quality, design and delivery
principles is meant to result in accredited and portable
courses that align with other qualifications in the national
framework (Brown et al., 2021; Cowie and Sakui, 2022).
Some researchers have argued that micro-credentials
can promote equity. They encourage access and
participation because they have low stakes. This makes
the risk of non-completion less daunting, perhaps
especially for those who feel out of place in a traditional
university environment. A recent summary of policy
advice on flexible learning pathways lists micro-credentials
as an opportunity to overcome persistent inequality
in adult education (van der Hijden and Martin, 2023).
The European Consortium of Innovative Universities
expects micro-credentials to make education more
accessible (ECIU, 2020). In 2022, the Council of the
European Union adopted a Recommendation, which
identifies micro-credentials as a means to cater to
the needs of learners from disadvantaged groups
(Council of the European Union, 2022). In the United States,
micro-credentials can signal extracurricular achievements
that are prized in college admissions that disadvantaged
youth are less likely to demonstrate (Gutierrez and
Martin, 2021).

are less likely to benefit from such micro-credentials.
In practice, micro-credentials tend to serve as a convenient
opportunity for lifelong learning for those already active in
these fields, who are disproportionately already privileged,
rather than as entry ramps for those who are not.
It has also been shown that even for those who obtain
micro-credentials, the potential benefits may be
outweighed by lower returns. Micro-credentials have not
yet conferred the same prestige as traditional degrees.
They are also not generally rewarded in the labour market
in the same way. Employers see micro-credentials
as complementary to, rather than substitutes for,
formal degrees (Kato et al., 2020). However, while
degree requirements have measurably declined in job
advertisements for middle- and high-skill positions,
this trend has not been clearly replaced by a demand
for micro-credentials. Moreover, many technology
companies continue requiring degrees despite their public
pronouncements of moving to skills-based hiring
(Fuller et al., 2022).
Ironically, one bottleneck to the greater recognition of
micro-credentials is that most digital recruitment
and human resource management technology does
not accept and process non-degree credentials
(Gallagher et al., 2023). There is a risk, therefore, that even
if micro-credentials were to be taken up by disadvantaged
groups, they would not be recognized, reinforcing
educational stratification. In the worst case, those
unprepared to navigate the maze of offered credentials
may end up with an incoherent, fragmented education
based on micro-credentials, which are poorly recognized
by employers and where it is uncertain what credit value
they receive for formal education (Kift, 2021).

However, a recent systematic literature review showed
that, whether from the perspective of learners, higher
education institutions or governments, the majority of
studies are sceptical about the ability of micro-credentials
to make such a contribution (Varadarajan et al., 2023).
The promise of micro-credentials contributing to education
equity is also undermined by their concentration in
STEM disciplines. As socially disadvantaged groups
are heavily underrepresented in these subjects, they

ICT skills are unevenly distributed. The proportion of youth and adults who had sent emails with an attachment
ranged from 65% in high- and 34% in upper-middle-income countries to 20% in lower-middle- and 3% in low-income
countries.

There has been progress in ICT skills. Of the 32 mostly rich countries with data on software management skills, 24
improved by at least five percentage points between 2015 and 2019.
There is clear gender disparity at women's expense at low ICT skills levels: Only 8 women in Pakistan's Balochistan
province can use a basic arithmetic formula in a spreadsheet for every 100 men who can. But at higher skill levels,
parity is achieved or the order of disparity is reversed: In Tonga, women are twice as likely as men to have this skill.
The gap by wealth is the widest. In Mongolia, 39% of adults from the richest quintile but just 1% from the poorest
quintile have spreadsheet skills.
Artificial intelligence is putting jobs at risk. In 2018, it was estimated that 54% of employees would require significant
reskilling to meet the demands of new tasks associated with their jobs. However, there may not be enough workers
who can train others. The relative supply of graduates in ICT, science and mathematics has remained remarkably
stable in recent decades.

SDG target 4.4 covers skills for work, a concept that is
crucial but hard to measure, context-specific and too
broad. The indicators that have been selected to monitor
it reflect the difficulties in identifying parameters for
progress for such a hard-to-define and moving target.
Required skills differ by labour market and change over
time. Each job requires a mix of skills and skills at different
levels of proficiency. Having a higher level of proficiency in
one skill may be an advantage for one job but irrelevant or
even a disadvantage for another. For this reason, two of
the three SDG target 4.4 indicators relate to the digital
transformation of economies in the belief that more and
more jobs will require such skills.
The first indicator is a self-reported measure of the use
of information and communication technology (ICT)
(global indicator 4.4.1). The second is intended to be a
directly assessed measure of digital literacy (thematic
indicator 4.4.2). Given the high cost of directly assessing
digital literacy skills, there is an ongoing attempt to merge
the two indicators by maintaining the less costly indirect
approach to assessment through household surveys
while expanding the set of ICT tasks that adults are
being asked to confirm they are familiar with. These
developments are discussed in the thematic part of the
report and in particular in the chapter dedicated to
digital skills (Chapter 5).
In 2015, nine tasks were specified to be part of the
global indicator. As these were meant to be carried
out on a computer or a tablet, there were demands
to amend the list of tasks assessed, for instance,
to also capture activities that can be performed with
smartphones or to drop activities that are becoming
obsolete. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
has responded to these demands with a number of actions,
including adding measures on safety, such as the use of
passwords, privacy settings and verifying the reliability
of information found online. Recommendations were also
made to streamline data collection and analysis. Skills are
no longer grouped as basic, intermediate or advanced,
given their propensity to change as software and apps
advance. Another change has been to review existing
responses to eliminate redundant specificity, for example,
to simplify from ‘using [a] basic arithmetic formula in

a spreadsheet’ to ‘using spreadsheet software’ and to
expand from ‘creating electronic presentations’ to ‘creating
something that combines different digital media’ in order
to accommodate the use of mobile phones.
However, as these changes have only been introduced
recently, this chapter reports on progress based on
the original nine tasks. The data, which come mainly
from richer countries and are therefore not globally
representative, show that 24% of adults can use a basic
arithmetic formula in a spreadsheet and 4% can write
a computer program using specialized programming
language. Of the 90 countries with data, most adults had
copied or moved a file or folder in 43 of them and had used
tools to copy and paste text in 36 countries. In contrast,
a majority of adults had created an electronic presentation
in only 2 of the 90 countries (Iceland and Luxembourg).
For each of the nine tasks, respondents in richer countries
report markedly higher rates of carrying out these
computer-related activities than in poorer countries.
For example, the proportion of youth and adults who
had sent emails with an attachment ranges from 65% in
high-income countries and 34% in upper-middle-income
countries to 20% in lower-middle-income countries and
3% in low-income countries.

15

Digital natives – those familiar with computers from an
early age – are not necessarily digital experts. While they
use technology more frequently than older generations,
ICT skills remain sparse in many countries’ youth and adult
populations. With the exception of high-income countries,
it is rare for more than a fifth of respondents to possess
any of the ICT skills.
ICT skills are more unequally distributed in the population
than basic literacy and numeracy skills are. Not only do
ICT skills require a minimum level of literacy and numeracy
skills but they are also used in mostly urban, formal sector
jobs that are scarce in poorer countries. Evidence from
UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) data sets
in 2017–22 on the ability to use a basic arithmetic formula
in a spreadsheet shows a diversity of inequality patterns
by sex, location and wealth.

There is clear gender disparity at the expense of women
at low levels of ICT skills. But at higher skill levels, this
trend stops and either parity is achieved or women are
more likely to have this skill. At the opposite extremes,
only 8 women in the Balochistan province of Pakistan
have this skill for every 100 young men who do, while
women are twice as likely as men to have this skill in Tonga
(Figure 15.4a).

B OX 15.1 :

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.4.1
Digital skills are increasingly incorporated into national curricula. At the same time, opportunities have grown to develop these
skills outside of formal education. This raises the question of the extent to which ICT skills have improved since the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) were set in 2015. There is a clear pattern of improvement across the mostly richer countries with data. Of the
32 countries with available data on managing software, 24 show an improvement of at least five percentage points between 2015 and
2019 (Figure 15.2). However, the sample does not contain any low-income countries.

Another way to understand progress is by looking at differences in
the ICT skill levels of various population groups. Since the sixth
round began in 2017, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster
Surveys (MICS) have been used to ask respondents whether they
have carried out these nine computer-related activities. In a
sample of 36 low- and middle-income countries, 20- to 24-yearold women are twice as likely to be able to use a basic arithmetic
formula in a spreadsheet than their 40- to 44-year-old peers.
There are considerable differences in the pace of change between
countries. In Argentina, there is practically no difference between
these two cohorts, while in Tunisia, the younger cohort is almost
four times as likely as the older cohort to have this skill. There are
also differences in the peak age of skill prevalence, which is
observed among 25- to 29-year-olds in Suriname, 20- to 24-yearolds in Algeria and 15- to 19-year-olds in Nepal (Figure 15.3).

The urban–rural gap is very wide. In the low-income
countries in this sample, almost no women living in rural
areas have this skill. In the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, 12.5% of urban women and 1.3% of rural women
can carry out this computer-related activity. The gap is
17 percentage points in Samoa and 23 points in Viet Nam
(Figure 15.4b).
The gap by wealth is the widest. In the low-income
countries, nearly no adults in the poorest 60% of
households have this skill when the national average is
below 10%. In Mongolia, 39% of adults from the richest
quintile but just 1% of their peers from the poorest quintile
have this skill. In Zimbabwe, none of the poorest but more
than 25% of the richest have this skill (Figure 15.4b).

Indicator 4.4.2 focuses on the percentage of youth and
adults who have achieved at least a minimum level of
proficiency in digital literacy skills, defined as the confident
and critical use of digital technologies for information,
communication and basic problem-solving. It covers the
use of computers to retrieve, assess, store, produce,
present and exchange information, and to communicate
and participate in collaborative networks via the internet.
The Programme for the International Assessment of
Adult Competencies (PIAAC) makes assessments in this
area. It has notably assessed respondents’ ability to use
technology to solve problems and accomplish complex
tasks. Among the 28 countries, most of which are
high-income, that took part in three waves of the survey
in the 2010s, those with tertiary education were almost
twice as likely to have basic proficiency in technology as
those without it.

The last indicator of this target, thematic indicator 4.4.3,
focuses on a proxy of actual skills for work: the educational
attainment rates of those aged 25 years and above. Given
the wide age range, differences in the distribution of
attainment reflect the different pace at which education
systems have expanded historically. Among 91 countries
with data, the percentage of those with at least upper
secondary education ranges from near zero (in Burundi
and Mali) to almost 100% (in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan)
(Figure 15.5).

FOCUS 15.1: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT
SKILL DEMAND AND SUPPLY
While the mission of education cannot be reduced to
preparing learners for future jobs, people do choose
education with the expectations of being able to secure
better work. The match between the skills students
acquire in education and those required and rewarded
in the labour market is, therefore, constantly being
questioned (Figueiredo et al., 2017). Such questions have
multiplied with rapid technological change. In recent years,
concerns have grown that advances in artificial intelligence
(AI) technology will have a more fundamental impact on
jobs than other technologies (Gaynor, 2020), not least with
the advent of large language models, such as ChatGPT.
The previous prediction that the robotics and automation
revolution would lead to the replacement of human
workers has not been realized. The demand for supposedly
obsolete manual human labour has not collapsed.
Labour markets have adapted, as efficiency gains from
automation have allowed labour to expand in other
areas. In the United States, the rise of automated teller
machines (ATM) for cash handling resulted in an increase
in the full-time equivalent number of human bank tellers
because, as ATMs made branch offices cheaper to
operate, more branches opened, leading to an increase in
employment (Haynes and Thompson, 2000).
Still, technology has had a massive, disruptive impact on
jobs, their skill content, remuneration and geographical
distribution worldwide. In many high-income countries,
a phenomenon of polarization has been documented,
whereby employment levels have increased for high- and
low-skill occupations, squeezing out middle-level skill
occupations that have proven to be more vulnerable to
automation. While low-skill jobs have become more poorly
paid, relative pay for high-skill jobs has been improving.
Many low-skill jobs moved from high-income countries
to low- and middle-income countries, a shift aided by
changes in trade policies (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011).

253

Technology has had a massive,
disruptive impact on jobs, their skill
content, remuneration and geographical
distribution worldwide

Numerous studies predict the effect of automation on
jobs. Based on a survey of adult workers in Europe,
an estimate from the European Centre for the
Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) puts the
share of jobs at risk of automation at 14% across the
European Union (Jaures, 2021). Limiting consideration
to ‘proven technologies’, one study identified only 5%
of all jobs in the United States as fully automatable
(Manyika et al., 2017). Defining automatable jobs as
those where more than 70% of the associated tasks are
automatable leads to an estimate of 9% of jobs at risk
across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (Arntz et al., 2016). Highlighting
the impact of specific assumptions and methodological
choices, the 2019 World Development Report on the future
of work estimated that the percentage of jobs at risk of
automation varied widely between studies, from a low of
5% to highs of 40% in Ukraine, 56% in Lithuania and even
61% in Cyprus (World Bank, 2018).
Analysis of technology effects on labour markets in
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries concluded that occupations at all levels of
the skills spectrum would lose some jobs and gain
others, with a net loss largely limited to the agricultural
sector (Oxford Economics and Cisco, 2018). A study
of 10 middle- and high-income countries based on
LinkedIn data documented shifting demand for different
occupations triggered by advances in digital technology
but also pointing out that the way skill profiles overlap
between different occupations differs significantly
between countries (Amaral et al., 2018). Workers access
different opportunities for moving out of declining
occupations in different countries.
To date, most of the AI technology that is causing concern
about AI taking over jobs is not yet market-ready, so it
is difficult to predict the impacts on jobs (Bessen, 2018).
A study of AI adoption in China showed that, as with
other technologies, it lowered demand for low skills
but increased demand for high skills (Xie et al., 2021).
Likewise, a study of online vacancies in the United States
from 2010 onwards detected no association between
AI exposure and the labour market at the level of whole
occupations or industries (Acemoglu et al., 2020),

suggesting that AI can only replace humans in
specific tasks and has not yet delivered significant
productivity gains.
Even jobs at a high risk of displacement from automation
and AI consist of a mixture of tasks, some of which are
more automatable than others. Estimating the future
labour market impact of AI should therefore not look at
entire occupations that might be replaced but instead at
tasks required in various professions. For instance, only
2 out of 29 tasks associated with the occupational profile
of radiologists concern image recognition, a task where
machine algorithms are expected to outperform humans
or already do so. By potentially freeing radiologists to
spend more time on expanding their role in diagnostic and
treatment teams with other physicians, their number could
increase (Agrawal et al., 2019).
One study went a step further and matched AI research
progress and labour-related tasks from European labour
markets to 14 cognitive abilities (such as sensorimotor
interaction or metacognition and confidence assessment)
to assess the extent to which AI is progressing to meet the
cognitive demands of various jobs. It was found that much
of AI research activity and progress is in cognitive areas
that are not essential to many jobs. Conversely, many
crucial skills for real-life tasks do not see much AI research
activity (Martínez-Plumed et al., 2020). Moreover, what
all these estimates have in common is that they strictly
assess which tasks are technically feasible to automate,
without regard to non-technological factors
and constraints (Poba-Nzaou et al., 2021).
Currently, people lack the skills for working with AI or
such skills are not in demand. It is still rare to have skills
such as being able to match the right AI tool to various
tasks, setting parameters, crafting the right prompts,
and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of
AI to critically interpret the response (Maskey, 2019).
Explicit demand for such skills is also rare, with less
than 1% of online job advertisements being AI-related
(Samek et al., 2021). However, there has been a clear
upward trend, in contrast to demand for general
computer and software skills (Alekseeva et al., 2021).
Vacancies asking for AI skills are mostly for professionals,
but AI skill requirements have started appearing in
advertisements for machine operators, craft workers and
other occupations, and agricultural and other industries.
Still, even for the legal services sector, where experts see
much potential for AI, the share of job advertisements
featuring keywords related to legal technology, AI, data
science or automation in Singapore, the United Kingdom
and the United States was less than 1% (Qian et al., 2020).

255

C H A P T E R 1 5 • S kills for work

Despite the rapid evolution of AI technology, the skills
expected of AI-related workers have changed little over the
past decade. The ability to work with AI includes significant
demand for socioemotional skills, such as communication,
creativity and teamwork, alongside cognitive ones
(Samek et al., 2021). The socioemotional aspects of jobs
become more prominent because these skills are less
likely to be automatized and because the right questions
must be asked for AI to answer. This was already true for
information technology (IT) specialists who were called
upon to ensure that IT solutions actually solved the right
problems. Human involvement and intelligence is required
to do this adjudication (Burbekova, 2021).
Rather than worrying whether AI will make workers
obsolete, attention should focus on training needs, both
in terms of training graduates with skills complementary
to digital transformation and the ability to train others.
One estimate was that 54% of employees will require
significant reskilling to meet the demands of the new tasks
associated with their jobs, with almost one in five requiring
at least six months of additional training (WEF, 2018).

One estimate was that 54% of employees
will require significant reskilling to meet the
demands of the new tasks associated with
their jobs

However, there may not be enough workers who can
train others. The supply of science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) graduates has remained
remarkably stable (Figure 15.6). The share of graduates
in digital technology subjects has grown, at most, very
slowly, as have the shares for both more scientific and
more applied STEM subjects. Digital technology graduates
make up some 5% of the total of STEM graduates,
scientists and mathematicians about 5%, and engineers
from 9% to 13%. Similar to the changing nature of
jobs, this stability may hide the fact that both science
and engineering, as well as non-STEM subjects, have
increasingly incorporated digital technologies and skills
within their subject boundaries. In the United Kingdom,
for instance, fewer than half of STEM graduates work in
occupations that are nominally STEM-related
(Grinis, 2019). While this may be misinterpreted as a
waste of their STEM training, it actually reflects the
fact that non-STEM occupations account for more than
a third of the jobs requiring STEM skills.

National skills strategies can provide a holistic
approach. These aim to bring together representatives
from all stakeholder groups to encourage a consensus
on developing the desired skills needed to work with
AI and technology, through awareness campaigns,
incentives, educational programmes and other voluntary
measures. In 2013, over 60 parties from central and
regional government, education institutions, regions,
industry, employer associations, and labour unions in the
Netherlands signed onto a technology ‘pact’
(Techniekpact) (EU STEM Coalition, 2023). The aim
was to improve the alignment between the job
market and the education sector, taking a centrally
supported but regional approach to increase entry into
technology-related subjects and progress into and
retention in technology-related jobs, with annual
impact monitoring and reporting (Cedefop, 2016).

In 2017, Portugal established a national strategy for
using AI in the economy and society as part of the
national digital competences initiative, Portugal
INCoDe.2030 (Bação, 2022). Annual forums convene
public and private sector institutions for sharing promising
practices. Activities are organized under five action lines
(Portugal INCoDe 2030, 2023): education and training,
(re-)qualification, inclusion, advanced training,
and research. Activities have included the creation of
industry network academies to support companies to
develop qualification plans for their employees; integration
of computing in school curricula; scholarships, including
to overcome gender barriers; coordination of research
and development under a National Artificial Intelligence
Strategy; and a national Coalition for Digital Employability.
The goals include doubling the share of ICT specialists
among employed persons to 7% and increasing the
share of ICT graduates from 2.2% in 2018 to 8% by 2030.
The initiative also conducted a study on employability in
the future to understand ICT skills development needs in
other professions (Portugal INCoDe 2030, 2023).

KE Y MESSAGES
The world overall achieved gender parity in primary and secondary education enrolment before 2015. But in
sub-Saharan Africa, parity is yet to be achieved. As of 2020, for every 100 males, there were 96 females enrolled
in primary, 91 in lower secondary, 87 in upper secondary and 80 in tertiary education.

Three aspects of gender parity trends need examination. First, girls in poor countries are worse off in secondary
completion than in secondary enrolment. Second, not all countries follow the global trend. Third, parity indices
measure average disparity; poor and rural girls in low- and lower-middle-income countries fare worse than average.
Gender gaps in learning outcomes are of an entirely different kind. Globally, in reading, for every 100 proficient
boys there are 115 proficient girls at the end of lower secondary education. But boys tend to have a considerable
advantage over girls in science and mathematics at the higher end of performance.
Children with at least one sensory, physical or intellectual difficulty were 7 percentage points less likely than the
average child to complete primary school; the gap was 10 percentage points in Zimbabwe and 14 points in Iraq.
These gaps may be underestimated, as poorer families are less likely to report that they have a child with disability.
First-generation students have it hard everywhere. For first-generation schoolgoers in low- and lower-middleincome countries, the median gap with other students in lower secondary completion is 34 percentage points.

The one exception to this success has been
sub-Saharan Africa, where parity has not been
achieved at any level of education. As of 2020,
for every 100 males, there were 96 females enrolled in
primary, 91 in lower secondary, 87 in upper secondary
and 80 in tertiary education. Conditions for girls and
young women worsened during the period of structural
adjustment in the 1990s and disparity increased in
secondary education. The 1997 level of the gender parity
index in lower secondary enrolment did not recover
until 2010. The 1999 level of the gender parity index in
upper secondary enrolment did not recover until 2013.
But between 2015 and 2020, the gender parity index in
upper secondary enrolment improved at the fastest rate
ever observed, by 0.012 points per year. Similar levels
of progress have been achieved in tertiary education
(Figure 16.1).

ne of the most notable successes in the
implementation of the international education agenda
over the past 30 years has been the move towards gender
parity in education. The world achieved gender parity in
primary and lower secondary education in 2009 and in
upper secondary education in 2013. Tertiary education
progress has been different. Parity was achieved a decade
earlier, in 1998, but by 2004, there was already disparity
at the expense of men, which has continued to increase: by
2020, there were 114 women enrolled for every 100 men
at this level of education.

The world achieved gender parity in primary
and lower secondary education in 2009 and in
upper secondary education in 2013

Three aspects of these trends need examination. First,
enrolment is only a stepping stone towards completion.
The most disadvantaged group tends to fare relatively
worse in terms of completion rates than in enrolment rates
(Box 16.1).

B OX 16.1 :

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.5.1
Global indicator 4.5.1, the education parity index that compares the education status of two groups, one disadvantaged and one
privileged, is defined in terms of other global education indicators (e.g. completion or learning), at various education levels (e.g. primary or
secondary) and for various individual characteristics (e.g. wealth or location). The potential combinations are so numerous that it is very
difficult to talk of one trend. It is particularly challenging to make global comparisons in terms of characteristics whose definitions vary
between countries. For example, definitions of urban and rural are not the same between countries, neither are definitions of poor and
rich. The latter definition may be based on income, consumption or wealth, with each concept meaning different things and leading to
different conclusions.
Progress towards gender parity in upper secondary completion is one of the most interesting trends to follow, given the variety of
contexts around the world – and is also the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 benchmark indicator on equity. Globally, gender
parity was achieved in 2010 but by 2017, there was reverse disparity, with 95 young men completing upper secondary school for every
100 young women. There are only two SDG regions where there is still disparity at the expense of young women but their trajectories
have been very different. In Central and Southern Asia, for every 100 young men who completed upper secondary school, there were
68 young women in 2000 but 94 in 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa started from a more equal position (75 young women completing for every
100 young men in 2000) but progressed at half the rate (88 young women for every 100 young men in 2020). On the positive side, the
rate of progress was twice as fast in 2008–20 as in 2000–08 (Figure 16.2).

However, it is necessary to not only look at disparity in the official ‘timely’ completion rate but also at the ‘ultimate’ completion rate,
i.e. the percentage of those who complete upper secondary school even later than three to five years after the official graduation age.
Disparity is lower in the latter rate: globally, there are 98 young men completing upper secondary school for every 100 young women.
This means that young men are more likely to complete upper secondary school late.
However, in sub-Saharan Africa, this gap is very large and indicative of a significant challenge facing girls and young women. While
88 young women complete upper secondary school on time for every 100 young men, ultimately only 79 young women do. Young women
who do not finish upper secondary school on time are more likely to leave school early, under pressure to marry and have children, while
young men can afford to persevere with their education for a little longer to obtain the upper secondary education certificate. There has
been no progress at all in closing this gap in the past 20 years. By contrast, this problem is not present at all in Central and Southern Asia,
and is one of the reasons that helps to explain the fast progress the region has achieved in closing the gender gap.

or reversed (e.g. Cambodia). One shows the maintenance
of parity throughout (e.g. Ecuador). The other two start
with an initial gap in favour of women, which declined
(e.g. Mongolia) or remained constant (e.g. the Philippines)
(Figure 16.3).

Second, countries’ trajectories depart from the global
trend. Globally, the gender gap in the out-of-school rate
among youth of upper secondary school age fell from
four percentage points in 2000 to zero in 2020. But it is
possible to observe six patterns. Three have a starting
point of an initial gap in favour of men, which remained

While the situation of girls and young women has improved dramatically, some are trapped
in pockets of disadvantage due to location and poverty – but also due to other social and
cultural characteristics
Third, even though the parity index indicates disparity,
it still only measures average disparity. While the situation
of girls and young women has improved dramatically, some
are trapped in pockets of disadvantage due to location
and poverty – but also due to other social and cultural
characteristics. For instance, in Mozambique, there are
73 young women in school for every 100 young men. But,
while there is gender parity in urban areas, in rural areas
there are 53 young women in school for every 100 young
men. By contrast, in the relatively few countries where
young men are, on average, at a disadvantage, their
disadvantage tends to be higher in urban areas, such as in
Mongolia and Palestine (Figure 16.4a).

The disparity is even more exacerbated in terms of wealth.
In a large number of low- and lower-middle-income
countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Nigeria and Pakistan, there is gender parity in school
attendance among the richest youth but substantial
disparity among the poorest. In Côte d’Ivoire, there are
72 young women in school for every 100 young men but
only 22 poor young women in school for every 100 poor
young men. Again, in the few countries where young
men are at a disadvantage, their disadvantage tends to
be higher among the poorest, such as in Bangladesh and
Lesotho (Figure 16.4b).

While girls and young women still face hurdles in education
access and completion in many poor countries, gaps
in learning outcomes are of an entirely different kind.
In reading, among 97 countries with data in upper primary
and lower secondary education in 2016–19, only two
low-income countries had a tiny gap favouring boys: Chad
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the other
95 countries, the share of girls with minimum proficiency
was an average of 10 percentage points higher than the
share of boys. Globally, for every 100 proficient boys,
there are 115 proficient girls in reading at the end of lower
secondary education.
Boys have a small advantage over girls in mathematics in
primary education, but this is reversed in lower secondary
education. In the 2019 Trends in Mathematics and Science
Study, the share of grade 4 boys with minimum proficiency
exceeded that of girls by 1.4 percentage points in
30 upper-middle and high-income countries. But by
grade 8, it was girls that had a 1.4 percentage point
advantage over boys (Figure 16.5a). In science, girls

263

C H A P T E R 1 6 • E quity

already have an advantage in grade 4 (by 1.9 percentage
points), which doubles by grade 8 (4.3 percentage points)
(Figure 16.5b).
However, it should be noted that these gaps relate to
the achievement of minimum proficiency; boys tend to
have a considerable advantage over girls in science and
mathematics at the higher end of performance (UNESCO,
2022). Although gender disparity has decreased over
time, boys are still more likely to be over-represented
among the highest performers in mathematics. Girls are
underrepresented at the top of the mathematics skills
distribution, even though they perform better than boys on
average (Baye and Monseur, 2016).

Boys have a small advantage over girls in
mathematics in primary education, but this is
reversed in lower secondary education

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated education inequality
and had unequal impacts on learning. Students from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds benefited less (Moscoviz
and Evans, 2022) from remote learning solutions because
they often lacked access to technology and were often
not sufficiently supported by parents or siblings. As a
result, learning loss was often concentrated among these
students: the loss was 60% higher for students in the
Netherlands whose parents had less education
(Engzell et al., 2021). In Italy, among children of less
educated parents, the learning loss was larger for girls
(Contini et al., 2021). In Belgium and the United States,
within-school inequalities increased (Kuhfeld et al.,
2020; Maldonado and Witte, 2022). In Mexico, 10- to
15-year-olds in the states of Campeche and Yucatan
were assessed in reading and numeracy between
2019 and 2021: overall, children and adolescents from low
socioeconomic groups experienced greater losses than
their peers, but losses were even greater for girls from the
lowest socioeconomic groups (Hevia et al., 2022).
While sex, location and wealth are the main characteristics
monitored in analyses of inequality in SDG 4, other
characteristics deserve attention, such as parental
education (Focus 16.1) and disability. The World Inequality
Database on Education (WIDE) has added disability to the

list of characteristics it uses to disaggregate educational
status, with the UNICEF Multiple Indicators Cluster
Survey being the main source of information. During the
fieldwork, at most, one child aged 5–17 per household
was assessed. Coverage varied widely across countries,
from 25% in Gambia to 78% in Cuba, although in most
countries it exceeded 50%. In general, households from the
richest quintiles and/or where parents had higher levels of
education had a smaller non-response rate than others.
For example, in Ghana the non-response rate for disability
was 64% among the poorest households and 50% among
the wealthiest. In Mongolia, households where parents had
completed primary education or less had a non-response
rate of 51%, compared to 39% among those where parents
had a higher education. Children appearing in the data
with some type of disability are disproportionately likely
to be located in households that are, on average, more
privileged.
Overall, children with at least one functional difficulty were
three percentage points less likely than the average child
to complete primary school but the gap was six percentage
points in Kiribati and nine in Guinea-Bissau. But children
with at least one sensory, physical or intellectual
difficulty, which is a narrower definition of disability, were
7 percentage points less likely than the average child to

complete primary school and the gap was 10 percentage
points in Zimbabwe and 14 points in Iraq (Figure 16.6).
However, these numbers need to be interpreted in light of
the fact that poorer families are less likely to report that
they have a child with a disability.

FOCUS 16.1: FIRST-GENERATION
STUDENTS HAVE IT HARD EVERYWHERE
The monitoring of target 4.5 has emphasized three
individual characteristics for which data are most
commonly available and which are assumed to be
comparable between countries: gender, socioeconomic
status and urban/rural location. While gaps in education
access and outcomes relating to these three dimensions
are considerable, other characteristics grouped under
the catch-all category of ‘vulnerable situations’ have
not received as much attention. One group that is not
mentioned at all in the SDG 4 framework is first-generation
learners, i.e. learners who are the first in their family to
attend a particular level of schooling. Emerging analyses
show that completing a level of education that one's

265

C H A P T E R 1 6 • E quity

parents never attended is a formidable challenge, whether
for children of illiterate parents in low-income countries
or first-in-their-family university students in high-income
countries.

Emerging analyses show that completing a
level of education that one's parents never
attended is a formidable challenge
While parental education often serves as a proxy for
socioeconomic status, first-generation learners face
specific education challenges that are distinct from
disadvantages resulting from poverty (Spiegler and
Bednarek, 2013). These challenges have as much to do
with cultural capital, such as familiarity with academic
etiquette (Collier and Morgan, 2008), and social capital,
such as social connections with teachers or faculty, as they
do with material resources. Less educated households may
also not be as familiar with the written and unwritten rules
of getting into higher levels of education.
First-generation students are more likely to have norms,
such as a belief in collaboration, that are at odds with
the more individualistic environment of higher education
(Phillips et al., 2020). They are also more likely to doubt
their skills and experience a fear of being exposed,
a feeling exacerbated in courses which tend to be more
competition-oriented, such as science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses
(Canning et al., 2020). First-generation students in France
suffered a greater negative impact on their performance
when compared explicitly to their classmates than did
other students (Jury et al., 2015).
Some recent research in the United States has
suggested that contrary to what is often believed,
caregivers with different levels of education show little
difference in parenting styles (Hastings and Pesando,
2022); in other words, it is not the case that the less
educated are less demanding parents. Instead, a crucial
constraint for schoolchildren is that their less educated
parents may not be familiar with the learning material
and cannot help with homework and assignments or give
first-hand advice on effective strategies on how to learn
(Portela and Atherton, 2020).
Analysis from Germany shows that children from
disadvantaged families, including less educated
households, are not as likely to receive a good grade,
even given identical performance, be recommended
for the academic secondary track even when receiving

16

identical grades, and actually choose the academic
track even when recommended to do so. This is a triple
disadvantage for learners taking a decision as early as the
age of 10 to 12 (Maaz, 2020). Data from the Programme
for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies
show as few as one in five complete tertiary education in
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries among those whose parents did not complete
upper secondary school, compared to two in three whose
parents were university educated (OECD, 2018).
Longitudinal data from the Young Lives project in Ethiopia,
India, Peru and Viet Nam also allow an analysis of what
happens when learners become first-generation students
once they progress beyond their parents’ schooling. At
age 8, when they are in primary school, relatively
few children are first-generation learners, except in
Ethiopia, where more than one in three are. But by age
15, when they are in secondary school, two thirds are
first-generation learners in all countries except Peru.
In India and Viet Nam, they have a greater risk of dropping
out from secondary school, a level above what their
parents had achieved (Portela and Atherton, 2020).
Even when first-generation students reach the top of the
attainment distribution, there is still inequality in learning.
In Ethiopia, first-generation learners are significantly
disadvantaged in terms of learning, even accounting for
poverty, and this gap widens over the course of schooling
(Iyer et al., 2020). Inequality extends higher up the
education ladder to distribution across disciplines and
institution prestige. Only 14% of recent US-born economics
Ph.D. recipients were first-generation college graduates,
dropping to only 5% at the top 6 economics departments.
This compares to 26% across all fields and over 40% of
education Ph.D. recipients (Schultz and Stansbury, 2022).
Such analyses require various methodological choices.
Whose education determines a young person’s
first-generation status at a given level? Do they cease
being first-generation if either of their parents attended
that level themselves, or only if both did? In practice,
although an imperfect choice, data coverage is maximized
if the focus is on the education of the head of household
or the highest-educated adult in the household, perhaps
above a certain minimum age (e.g. 25 years), in an
attempt to exclude older siblings. More than half of all
students in tertiary education in the United States may be
first-generation (Laiduc et al., 2021; Redford and Hoyer,
2017). However, this estimate is highly dependent on the
definition used: a study using a sample of 7,300 students
found that the share ranged from 22% to 77%, depending
on which of several definitions was used
(Toutkoushian et al., 2018).

In an extension of the WIDE, which has been documenting
the level and change of education inequality since 2010,
the GEM Report team has analysed individual education
status according to the education level of the head of
household, the aim of which is to understand the extent
of first-generation learners’ disadvantage compared to
their peers. One measure is the relative gap in primary and
lower-secondary completion by first-generation status
in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The median
gap in primary completion is 23 percentage points and
exceeds 40 points in Nigeria, which is larger than the
urban–rural gap. The median gap between first-generation
and non-first-generation adolescents in lower secondary
completion is 34 percentage points and reaches 46 points
in Cameroon and 50 points in Madagascar (Figure 16.7).

First-generation disadvantage is related to but distinct
from intergenerational educational mobility: the strong
relationship between the educational attainment of
parents and children means there is lower mobility
(Bhalotra et al., 2015; Razzu and Wambile, 2022). In the
context of educational expansion and increasing mobility
where a large number of first-generation students is a
positive development, the question then becomes how
to help them succeed. In a context of few first-generation
students and low mobility, the question is how to increase
their number.
In a study of intergenerational educational mobility over
50 years in Comoros, Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi,
Nigeria, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and
Uganda, parental education accounted for 51% of the
inequality in children’s years of schooling. This suggests
that levels of educational mobility in sub-Saharan Africa
are similar to those in Asia and higher than those observed
in Latin America. In most countries in the study, there
was a moderate increase in mobility over time, driven by
progress towards universal, mandatory and free primary
schooling. Notably, educational mobility was higher when
education was given a higher priority in public expenditure
(Azomahou and Yitbarek, 2016). While first-generation
disadvantage persists in upper-middle- and high-income
countries, examples of higher mobility have been
documented, such as girls in Türkiye (Abdurrahman and
Hakki, 2019), learners in richer regions in Italy (Güell et al.,
2018) and in the United States (Chetty et al., 2014).
A range of initiatives tries to address challenges faced
by first-generation learners (Whitley et al., 2018).
For example, campaigns may focus on role models who
highlight their status as first-in-their-family graduates
who achieved academic success. First-generation
students felt greater belonging and were more likely
to seek support when meeting faculty whose own
first-generation status was made explicit. The University
of California implemented a First-Generation Initiative
across its 10 campuses in 2017 to raise awareness,
create an inclusive and supportive culture, and ensure
that first-generation students were connected to relevant
resources and networks (Laiduc et al., 2021).

267

C H A P T E R 1 6 • E quity

While campaigns are focused on encouraging
first-generation students to enrol, other mechanisms are
required to support them at institutions once they do.
Some schools offer support programmes by assigning
mentors or buddies who can explain how things work at
the university, reducing reliance on cultural capital at home.
A study of a supplementary curriculum, a three-week
orientation course followed by targeted counselling and
mentorship, offered to first-generation students from poor
rural families at an engineering school in Chennai, India,
found that the special curriculum helped them to overcome
social and cultural barriers but the participants doubted
that higher education alone would be enough to overcome
the challenges they face in competing with their peers for
gainful employment (Vijayakumar, 2020).
First-generation learners can also be supported by
programmes targeting their family members. If family
members prioritize education, they can facilitate the
success of their children through non-material support
(Gofen, 2009), even if they are not familiar with higher
education (Spiegler and Bednarek, 2013).
For support programmes to succeed, it must first be
recognized that first-generation students are far from
homogeneous, and that first-generation status intersects
with other forms of disadvantage (Nguyen, 2018).
Moreover, institutional support structures may undermine
first-generation students’ sense of belonging if they frame
support in terms of overcoming a supposed limitation
(Means and Pyne, 2017). Rejecting a deficit view, many
first-generation students see themselves as being more
motivated, adaptable and, almost by definition, more
self-reliant (Tate et al., 2015), contributing positively to
their academic confidence and consequently their learning.

KE Y MESSAGES
The world youth literacy rate increased from 87% in 2000 to 91% in 2015, but increased by less than one further
percentage point by 2020. The number of illiterate youth fell from 107 million in 2015 to 99 million in 2020.

The adult literacy rate (ages 15 to 64) increased from 81% in 2000 to 86% in 2015 and 87% in 2020; the increase was
just 1.2 percentage points over the last five years.
Adult literacy rates increase because younger, more educated population cohorts replace older, less educated
cohorts. Following individual cohorts in Cambodia, Kenya and Nepal shows that their literacy rates remain the same,
or even decrease somewhat, as they get older.
Improvement in women's literacy status has been exceptionally fast. In India, 46% of 45- to 49-year-old women but
90% of 15- to 19-year-old women were literate in 2020–21. In Sierra Leone, 18% of 35- to 39-year-old women but
74% of 15- to 19-year-old women were literate in 2019. Male literacy rates, however, have progressed very slowly in
Gambia, Liberia and Mauritania.
Average reading speed increases through primary school but differs significantly by language because languages
and writing systems vary in how much information a single word conveys, and in how many words are required to
express the same information.

literacy rate indicator based on direct assessment
and recognizing multiple levels of proficiency was
introduced in the SDG 4 monitoring framework to
capture the evolution of thinking on what it means to
be literate, as well as to motivate countries to invest
in literacy assessments. However, due to the high
cost of assessment, weak implementation capacity
and insufficient demand, very few upper-middle- and
high-income countries have carried out such assessments

since 2015. As a result, literacy monitoring has reverted to
the traditional binary distinction of literate vs non-literate.
However, the information sources available that make
this distinction, reductive as it is, are not good enough.
The traditional assumption that having completed four
years of education is equivalent with being literate has
long been disproved. Self-reporting of the ability to
read and write is still being used in some population
censuses and labour force surveys but is also problematic.

B OX 17.1 :

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.7.1
Globally, the youth literacy rate increased from 87% in 2000 to 91% in 2015, but has only increased by 0.8 percentage points since
then. Of the two regions that were well below the global average in 2000, Central and Southern Asia has improved at an annual rate
three times as fast as the global rate of progress, almost converging with the global average rate: its youth literacy rate increased from
74% in 2000 to 88% in 2015 and 90% in 2020. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa’s rate has converged more slowly, the youth literacy rate
increasing from 66% in 2000 to 75% in 2015 and 77.5% in 2020 (Figure 17.1a). The number of illiterate youth fell from 107 million in
2015 to 99 million in 2020, of which 36 million were in Central and Southern Asia and 49 million were in sub-Saharan Africa. Women are
56% of all illiterate youth.
The adult literacy rate, for people aged 15 to 64 years, has increased from 81% in 2000 to 86% in 2015 and 87% in 2020, an increase of
just 1.2 percentage points in five years. Sub-Saharan Africa has improved at a rate twice as fast as the global average since 2000, but
its adult literacy rate was just 64% in 2020, compared to 73% in Central and Southern Asia. (Figure 17.1b). The number of illiterate adults
dropped from 783 million in 2015 to 763 million in 2020, of which 367 million were in Central and Southern Asia and 205 million were in
sub-Saharan Africa, where the number increased by 9 million. Women are 63% of all illiterate adults. Almost one quarter of the elderly
above age 65 are illiterate (Figure 17.1c). The elderly literacy rate in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia increased from 60% in 2000 to
84% in 2020.

However, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)
has been incorporating into its literacy estimates
(Box 17.1) information from household surveys, notably
the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), which include a
rudimentary but direct measure of the ability to read a
simple sentence. One disadvantage is that these surveys
only sample adults aged 15 to 49 years, and usually only
women, which requires more assumptions to be made for
the entire adult population.
But even so, household surveys shed light on the process
by which adult literacy rates change. There are two
potential mechanisms in operation. First, as younger, more
educated cohorts replace older, less educated cohorts,
the adult literacy rate increases by virtue of the changing
population composition. Second, adult literacy rates can
also change through adult literacy programmes. Data
from two Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) rounds
in selected low- and middle-income countries show little
evidence that the latter mechanism is at play: literacy
programmes, even when effective, rarely reach the scale
required to have a visible impact at population level.

Literacy programmes, even when effective,
rarely reach the scale required to have a visible
impact at population level

In India, two successive rounds of the DHS were carried
out five years apart from each other, in 2015–16 and in
2020–21, respectively. If adult education programmes
were effective and at scale, then the literacy rates
of, say, the cohort of 30- to 34-year-old women in
2020–21 should be higher than the literacy rates of the
cohort of 25- to 29-year-old women in 2015–16. But in
India, as in Cambodia, Kenya and Nepal, the literacy rates
of these cohorts remain the same or even decrease
somewhat (Figure 17.2d).

The cohort analysis also documents differences in
countries’ trajectories. For instance, it shows the
devastating impact of the Cambodian genocide: adults
in their 40s have lower literacy rates than their peers in
their 50s (Figure 17.2c). It also shows that countries in
the same region can achieve different rates of progress.
For example, in western Africa: in Sierra Leone, where
some of the lowest literacy rates in the world are found,
female literacy rates have increased exponentially: in
2019, only 18% of 35- to 39-year-old women but 74% of
15- to 19-year-old girls could read. Male literacy rates
have also increased rapidly. By contrast, male literacy
rates have progressed very slowly in the Gambia, Liberia
and Mauritania: in Gambia, 64% of 45- to 49-year-old men
and 72% of 15- to 19-year-old young men are literate,
an increase of just 8 percentage points in 30 years.
In Liberia and Mauritania, youth literacy rates even appear
to have fallen in the latest five-year period (Figure 17.3).
Household surveys help improve the reliability of
literacy estimates that previously relied only on indirect
measurement. But it is important to remember that,
even when direct assessments of sentence reading
skills are used, the definition of functional literacy is
very basic. There is a huge gap between such estimates
of adult literacy and those based on more detailed
direct assessments of adult literacy skills, such as the
Programme for International Assessment of Adult Skills
(PIAAC) surveys. For example, while the official literacy
rate in Ecuador is 89%, only 28% of adults achieved the
minimum level of proficiency in PIAAC (level 2), which
recognizes the ability of respondents to match the text
with additional information, to paraphrase and to draw
low-level inferences, such as identifying information from
various parts of a document.
Another strength of household surveys is that they enable
literacy rates to be disaggregated by individual background
factors. In a sample of 37 low- and middle-income
countries, the average urban–rural gap in youth literacy
(15–24 years) was 9 percentage points (reaching 29 points
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), while in adult
literacy (25–49 years), it was 13 percentage points
(reaching 34 points in Ghana).
Literacy is linked to various significant outcomes. A literate
woman is more likely to benefit from health campaigns,

be informed of modern health methods, and to have
more tools to overcome detrimental gender norms
(Deschênes and Hotte, 2021). According to MICS data,
literacy is associated with a slightly higher probability of
using modern contraceptives (by about 2.5 percentage
points). In some countries, the difference is much bigger.
In Palestine, the gap in modern contraceptive use between
literate and illiterate women is 35 percentage points in
urban areas and 22 percentage points in rural areas. Where
the contraceptive supply is scarce and gender norms are
pervasive, literacy may play an even more critical role.

Global indicator 4.6.1 covers literacy and numeracy.
The five domains of numeracy (civic, digital, financial and
business, health and workplace) (UIL, 2020) clearly relate
to SDG targets 4.1 and 4.4. The quality of education and
the acquisition of mathematics skills during primary and
secondary school is a determinant for the acquisition of
adult numeracy skills and relevant skills for employment.
Unfortunately, data for numeracy are even more limited
than for literacy. In the 38 mostly high-income countries
that took part in the three waves of PIAAC in the 2010s,
only Japan exceeded 90% in terms of the numeracy
skills of its adult population. Fewer than half of adults
from upper-middle-income countries that took part in
the second (2015) and third (2017) rounds of PIAAC had
minimum proficiency in numeracy, including in Ecuador
(23%), Peru (25%), Mexico (40%) and Türkiye (49%). The
only upper-middle-income country where the majority
of adults had at least minimum numeracy skills was
Kazakhstan (73%).

FOCUS 17.1: DOES READING SPEED
MATTER?
Learning outcomes have risen to the top of the
post-2015 international education agenda with reading
comprehension the measure receiving the most attention.
But if reading comprehension is to be improved, the means
to that end – the mechanics of reading – must be
understood.
Comprehension has a non-linear relationship with reading
speed. Read too slowly, and you forget how a sentence
started by the time you reach the end. But read too quickly,
and you start skipping over information. While both effects
are obvious at the extremes, the extent to which reading
speed matters as a benchmark for learning is contested.
Reading speed differentials among individual students
mirror their test score gaps. Cognitive correlates of
higher reading speed include working memory and fluid
intelligence (Johann et al., 2020). A positive correlation
between reading speed and reading comprehension at
the individual level has been empirically found in a diverse
range of languages, including Turkish (Soysal, 2022b)
and German (Johann et al., 2020).
Yet across countries, high levels of comprehension are
achieved at different reading speeds. Some studies
question the usefulness of reading speed as a metric
or proxy for learning (Dowd and Bartlett, 2019; Graham
and van Ginkel, 2014), although the methodology of such
analyses and their consistency with cognitive research are
disputed (Abadzi and Centanni, 2020).

There are physiological limits to the speed at which
the human eye can fixate and scan each word in a text
(Seidenberg, 2018). At some point, reading faster means
no longer processing every word. Reading, ‘the processing
of textual information so as to recover the intended
meaning of each word, phrase, and sentence’, turns into
skimming – ‘[moving] one’s eyes through the text to find
a specific word or piece of information or to get a general
idea of the text content’ (Rayner et al., 2016, p. 5), which is
a distinct skill in its own right.
Efforts at ‘speed reading’ have a long and controversial
history. There is a lack of evidence for the most optimistic
claims of fantastic speeds with full comprehension
(Rayner et al., 2016; Seidenberg, 2018), The question
remains whether speed reading is even desirable
(Tsvetkova, 2017; Wolf and Klein, 2022). Comprehension
and retention inevitably deteriorate at extreme speeds.
The fastest confirmed reading speed in English with
comprehension achievable under laboratory conditions,
with words displayed sequentially at the same point with
no need for eye movement, and at an optimized print size,
exceeds no more than 800 words per minute (wpm)
(He et al., 2018).
The average words per minute for reading in the
adult population, and what is expected of learners at
different grade levels and ages, is far lower. Based on a
meta-analysis of 190 studies, the silent reading speed
for English non-fiction of most adults falls in the range of
175 to 300 wpm, with an average of 238 wpm (Brysbaert,
2019). Reading fiction is slightly faster, reflecting that it
has, on average, shorter words.
Some studies focus on individual correlates. Reading is
likely to benefit from many of the same factors that confer
educational advantage in general, such as the availability
of books in the home. But when, for instance, positive
attitudes towards reading and higher reading speed
go together, the direction of causality remains unclear.
Do keen readers improve their speed by reading more,
or are fluent readers more motivated to use their skill?
Perhaps both work to create a virtuous circle. More telling
is the effect of improvements in reading speed.
Grade 4 to 6 students who received 28 hours of instruction
in techniques to improve their reading speed reported
greater enjoyment of reading, greater motivation caused
by the ability to read more books in the same time,
and further reported that they were no longer intimidated
by long books (Soysal, 2022a).
Individual differences in reading speed tend to be larger
than by age or grade. Despite this, reading speed data
by age or grade reveal clear developmental patterns as

children learn to read. Similar to findings from the United
States (Spichtig et al. 2016), a study in Brazil found that the
average reading speed continued to improve from
grades 2 to 9, albeit more slowly beyond grade 7
(Alves et al., 2021) (Figure 17.4). This pattern is also
reflected in grade norms (Hasbrouck and Tindal, 2017).

Even more challenging is the standardization of reading
speed measurement across languages, and especially
across different scripts and writing systems. Much
research on reading deals specifically with reading
English. This is unfortunate, not only in terms of cultural
bias, but also because the linguistic properties of English
are far from typical. In particular, English orthography is
highly irregular. Unlike in Spanish, Korean and many other
languages, it is not possible to reliably predict how an
unfamiliar English word is pronounced based on written
representation alone.

The extent to which reading speed depends on word
decoding or language comprehension changes with
increasing fluency and, by implication, school grade
(Carretti et al., 2020). Reading speed continues to increase
up to school-leaving age and starts to decline slowly
around age 40, by some 10% by age 70 (Brysbaert, 2019).
However, the decline is related to changing vision (Liu et al.,
2017) and not necessarily cognition.
Measured reading speed drops further if only counting
words read correctly. Oral reading fluency, as measured
by the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA),
an international assessment tool, indicates the number
of words correctly read aloud, which is inherently slower

275

than silent reading. The instructions for EGRA are to not try
to read as fast as possible. But correctness may add little
extra statistical information beyond speed (Williams et al.,
2011), because faster readers also tend to be more fluent.
Correctness still offers some advantages as a measure.
For instance, while outlier scores may be produced in
the measurement of silent reading, when readers get
stuck on a difficult word, a prompt can be given if they
are reading aloud. Oral fluency may also be more closely
related to comprehension; testing it allows the collection
of information on errors (Piper and Zuilkowski, 2015).
Crucially, however, such a link with comprehension does
not persist across languages, calling into question the use
of English reading fluency as a proxy target for learning
among non-native speakers in sub-Saharan Africa, even
when the language of instruction is English (Piper et al.,
2016).

C H A P T E R 1 7 • Y outh and adult literacy

Directly comparable or not, reading speed measures have
been adapted to various languages. The International
Reading Speed Texts (IReST) consist of 10 short
paragraphs of around 150 words each and are available for
17 languages (Trauzettel-Klosinski et al., 2012), including
languages with non-Latin scripts including Greek
(Gleni et al., 2019) and Chinese (Wang et al., 2018). A review
of 232 reading speed studies (Brysbaert, 2019) in various
languages not limited to IReST suggests that average
reading speed differs significantly in different countries
and languages (Figure 17.5).
These differences are measured in words per minute.
But this raises the question of how to account for
differences in the definition of a ‘word’, for instance
with respect to prefixes, suffixes and whether articles
and pronouns appear as separate words. Approaches
to accounting for such effects include counting each
component of compound words (Abadzi, 2012). In Chinese,
word boundaries are well-defined even if, in writing,
spaces between words are not normally inserted or indeed
required for fluent reading (Ling and Liu, 2021). In contrast
to English, which uses between five and six letters per

word on average, Chinese words typically consist of only
one or two complex characters (Brysbaert, 2019).
In summary, languages and writing systems differ in
how much information is encoded in a single word,
and in verbosity, that is, how many words are required
to express the same information. Verbosity and average
reading speed are correlated, meaning that each word
tends to take longer to read in languages that encode
more information per word (Brysbaert, 2019). As a result,

Reading unvowelled Arabic requires
a significant amount of simultaneous
grammatical decoding

amount of simultaneous grammatical decoding. Moreover,
native Arabic speakers are almost universally native
speakers of various Arabic dialects that differ from
standard Arabic in vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.
Accordingly, formal Arabic is de facto their second
language. The fact that reading speed points to the relative
difficulty of written Arabic may be one explanation of why
adult literacy in many Arab countries is lower than would
be expected, given the levels of income and schooling.
A study of the reading speed achieved by learners of
Arabic, who are not native speakers of a spoken variant
of colloquial Arabic, at different proficiency levels showed
interesting nuance (Midhwah and Alhawary, 2020):
fully vowelled text is generally read more slowly than
unvowelled text, but both variants are read faster by
students learning from vowelled textbooks. The reading
speed of Arabic is also slower than that of Hebrew, which
uses a different script but is otherwise linguistically closely
related (Eviatar et al., 2019).
Measurements of reading speed are not perfectly
standardized, even when some parameters are fixed –
for example, reading silently or aloud, counting all words
or only those read correctly, and reading text or isolated
words (or even non-words). The technical properties of the
material being read also matter to some extent, including
font size, colour and contrast (Wallace et al., 2022; Zhu,
2022), as well as environmental factors such as distance
and lighting (Jung and Choi, 2021).
The effect of digital display technology on reading speed
is ambiguous, however. Reading speeds on tablets and
e-ink readers need not be slower than paper (Moys et al.,
2018; Sackstein et al., 2015), but have no clear advantage
either. Malay students were found to read faster on paper,
but demonstrated better comprehension on screens
(Tajuddin and Mohamad, 2019). A meta-analysis found
that the consistent advantage of paper for reading speed
has not declined over time with increasing digitalization
(Delgado et al., 2018).

how long it takes to read the same information differs less
between languages than the reading speed measured in
words per minute.
A notable outlier in silent reading speed is Arabic. It is
argued that Arabic is inherently slow to read because
formal Arabic customarily omits the signs for short vowels
in handwriting and print except in children’s books (to help
early readers) and religious texts (for unambiguity). As a
result, reading unvowelled Arabic requires a significant

KE Y MESSAGES
Almost all governments report that their education systems cover most of the global citizenship and sustainability
development themes identified in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 4.7. Alternative monitoring
mechanisms that do not rely on self-reporting include a new indicator on green content in curriculum frameworks
and syllabuses, due for release in 2024; and a compilation of countries’ laws and policies on climate change
education and communication, to which the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report is contributing.

Analysis of 50 PEER (Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews) country profiles finds that even though countries are
mainstreaming climate change in the curricula, only 39% have a national law, policy or strategy specifically focused
on climate change education and 63% of teacher training plans include a focus on climate change. By contrast, 94% of
countries mention public awareness in laws, policies or plans related to climate change communication.
There is little explicit concern in SDG 4 about how students learn, leaving out an important piece of the story of why
learning occurs or does not. That missing piece is affect, or how learners feel.
Evidence from neuroimaging aligns with teacher experience indicating that social and emotional factors and skills
strongly affect classroom learning. It is crucial both in traditional classrooms and in technology-heavy learning
environments to ensure that learning is promoted rather than inhibited by learners’ emotions. Unfortunately, few
systematic international data are collected on the extent to which social and emotional skills learners have and if or
how these are fostered at school.

DG target 4.7 is unique among the 10 targets in its
focus on education outcomes that cannot easily be
measured: human rights, gender equality, peace and
non-violence, global citizenship, and cultural diversity
and culture’s contribution to sustainable development.
Nevertheless, global indicator 4.7.1 tries to tackle
the difficult question of how to monitor progress.
In particular, it invites countries to report on the extent
to which they are mainstreaming global citizenship

education and education for sustainable development
in their education systems. It builds on a self-reporting
mechanism, the consultation on implementation of
UNESCO’s 1974 Recommendation concerning Education
for International Understanding, Cooperation and Peace
and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms. Reporting is meant to take place every four
years, but data availability has been low, preventing a
review of progress (Box 18.1).

B OX 18.1 :

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.7.1
Global indicator 4.7.1 monitors the extent to which global citizenship education and education for sustainable development are
mainstreamed in national education policies, curricula, teacher education and student assessment. The indicator’s four components
are each scored on a scale of 0 to 1, based on whether eight themes have been mainstreamed: cultural diversity and tolerance, gender
equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and
sustainable consumption and production.
According to the last consultation, which covers the period 2017–20 and whose results were published in 2021, almost all reporting
governments claim that their education systems cover most of the themes to a substantial extent (Figure 18.1). For each of the four
components, most countries scored above 0.8, which means at least six of the eight themes are mainstreamed into their curricula,
policies, teacher education and assessment. Almost no countries scored below 0.5, i.e. reported that only a minority of the themes were
mainstreamed. No relationship between responses and country income was found.

A UNESCO-led process aims to supersede the
1974 Recommendation with new text reflecting
contemporary needs. The proposed text includes, for the
first time, a section on follow-up and review, which
provides guidance on actions that can be taken to monitor
implementation of the Recommendation and learn from
best practices. However, neither the Recommendation
itself nor the guidance in the follow-up and review section
would be binding.
In any case, self-reporting by governments will continue
to be the source of information. While this arrangement
facilitates higher participation by countries, the lack
of reliability and comparability reduces its value as a
monitoring mechanism. Complementary reporting that
relies on expert analysis is needed to enrich the type
of evidence used and to offer a future alternative for
monitoring and reporting.
Two examples are worth mentioning. Climate change
education was a focus of discussion at the UN
Transforming Education Summit in September 2022 in
New York. This has intensified calls for identifying a
measure of progress, including a potential benchmark
indicator. An initiative supported by UNESCO aims to
introduce an indicator on prioritization and integration of
green content in national curricular frameworks, and in the
syllabuses of selected science and social science subjects,
to measure the extent to which sustainability, climate
change and environmental themes are covered in primary
and secondary education. Official documents are being
collected for some 100 countries and the first results are
to be released in early 2024. These would be based on
expert analysis of the frequency of selected keywords in
these documents.
The other example is a collaboration between the
GEM Report and the Monitoring and Evaluating Climate
Communication and Education project. It involves
gathering information in 70 countries on laws and policies
supporting peer learning on climate change education
and communication. These country profiles will enable
comparison of countries’ progress on Article 6 of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
and Article 12 of the Paris Agreement, through Action
for Climate Empowerment, and on SDG target 4.7. Each
country profile analyses the context for climate change
communication and education; climate change education
policies and curriculum at all levels; climate change
communication, including public awareness, public access
to education and public participation; and monitoring and
evaluation.

Countries have made great strides in
mainstreaming climate change in the curricula
at all levels of education
Some key findings can be drawn from a preliminary
analysis of the first 50 profiles (UNESCO, 2022). Countries
have made great strides in mainstreaming climate change
in the curricula at all levels of education: 90% of countries
have laws, policies or plans that include climate change in
primary and secondary education. However, only 39% of
countries have a national law, policy or strategy specifically
focused on climate change education. In Ethiopia,
the 2020 national curriculum framework includes
environment and climate change in all subjects in
grades 1 to 12 as a cross-cutting issue, supported by
a 2019 guide on integrating climate change into the
curriculum. In Zambia, the 2021 national climate change
learning strategy commits to integrating climate change
in learning and teaching materials from early childhood to
secondary education.
Few countries incorporate psychosocial or social or
emotional learning on climate change into primary and
secondary education (Focus 18.1). In China, the Guidelines
for the Implementation of Environment Education in
Primary and Secondary Schools target feelings, attitudes
and values and aspire to prepare learners to care for
nature and respect life, different views and cultural
diversity. In Ecuador, the Manual of Good Environmental
Practices for Educational Institutions applies both
cognitive and action learning dimensions by promoting
campaigns, seminars and environmental activities at
school. More commonly, countries address action learning
in relation to climate change. In Ghana, the 2018 National
Pre-Tertiary Education Curriculum Framework encourages
learners to take climate actions that foster sustainable
development. For instance, the science curriculum in
grades 4 to 6 aims to help students understand the effects
of climate change and take responsible action to protect
the environment. Other countries – such as Namibia
in its 2019 environmental education and education for
sustainable development policy – encourage schools
to run extracurricular activities. In Saint Lucia, children
are involved in gardening with the support of farmers,
caretakers and extension officers from the community.
Some countries are embracing the transition to green
and sustainable schools. Japan promotes eco-schools,
which save energy, reduce carbon emissions and
offer environmental education. In Kenya, the UNESCO
Associated Schools Project Network covers green school

facilities management. For example, learners in nursery,
primary and secondary schools study how to design and
maintain the school garden and how to compost. At the
global level, the international Eco-Schools initiative,
launched in 1994 by the Foundation for Environmental
Education, is now implemented in more than
43,000 schools around the world.

2022). Moreover, cognitive tasks for learning invariably
activate and use areas of the brain specialized in social
and emotional activity. It is essentially impossible to
perform a cognitive task without experiencing positive or
negative emotions towards it, and people perform better
on cognitive tasks towards which they have a positive
attitude.

Capacity-building initiatives for climate change are
gaining momentum: 63% of teacher training plans include
a focus on climate change. In Cambodia, the education
ministry introduced modules to help teachers integrate
environmental topics such as climate change in formal and
non-formal curricula. In all, 71% of the countries include
training for government workers.

Mathematics anxiety is common and is
estimated to account for 14% of the variation
in mathematics performance in OECD
countries

Public awareness is the most common communication
approach, with 94% of the countries mentioning public
awareness in laws, policies or plans related to climate
change. In 2021, Malta’s national public awareness
campaign #ClimateON aimed to shift citizens’ habits
towards greener and more enriching lifestyles.
Climate change plans and programmes focus on
public participation, with 88% of countries including
such an element in their laws, policies and plans,
and 86% identifying youth as a target audience. In Nauru,
the 2015 Framework for Climate Change Adaptation and
Disaster Risk Reduction emphasizes including youth in
planning and decision making.

FOCUS 18.1: ALL LEARNING IS SOCIAL
AND EMOTIONAL
Aside from target 4.7, the SDG 4 indicator framework does
not focus on the content of learning. Even the global and
thematic indicators for target 4.7, however, are concerned
almost exclusively with academic content knowledge
and cognitive skills. There is little explicit concern for
how students learn. This partly reflects a lack of suitable
measurement instruments and comparative data. Yet the
measurement challenges are not necessarily greater than
for some of the cognitive indicators that are included in
the framework. Moreover, ignoring the non-cognitive
dimension of learning or reducing learning to only some
skills, such as perseverance, leaves out an important piece
of the story of why learning does or does not take place.
That missing piece is affect, or how learners feel.
Early educational psychologists believed learning was
inherently emotional. This has now been scientifically
established through advances in neuroscience
(Immordino-Yang et al., 2019). Cognitive skills important
for learning, such as attention and memory, are strongly
linked to or guided by emotions (LeBlanc and Posner,

281

C H A P T E R 1 8 • E S D and G C E D

For example, emotions relating to social relationships
with parents and teachers, as well as to cultural goals
such as a desire to go to university, influence student
motivation for trying to solve a mathematics problem.
Emotions also guide cognitive steps, leading towards a
solution or away from it (Immordino-Yang and Fischer,
2010). For instance, mathematics anxiety is common
and is estimated to account for 14% of the variation in
mathematics performance in OECD countries (Chang and
Beilock, 2016). In addition, emotions guide judgement
and action in transferring skills and knowledge from the
structured school environment to real-world decision
making (Immordino‐Yang and Damasio, 2007), which is
critical for the changes in behaviour that target 4.7 is trying
to achieve.
In addition to being emotional, learning is social. Humans
have fewer hardwired behaviours than simpler species
or even plants. The evolutionary loss of predetermined
genetic information enables and necessitates social
learning (Deacon, 2011; Rogoff, 2003). Conversely, social
and environmental adversity and disadvantage, such as
poverty, leave neurobiological traces that partly explain
their detrimental effect on education (Sheridan and
McLaughlin, 2016). Even controlling for genetic variation,
socioeconomic status during childhood affects neural
structure and cortical thickness, for instance.
Teachers and education researchers have long known
from common sense, experience, and observational or
quasi-experimental research that students’ emotions
and attitudes affect their learning (Pekrun and
Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014), including motivation and
factors such as self-efficacy. Learners who want to study,
and believe that if they do they will succeed, are more likely
to learn. By contrast, anger is at best a distraction and at
worst an obstacle to learning. However, this does not mean
the relationship between positive and negative emotions

18

and learning is deterministic. Students who are perfectly
happy with their current state of knowledge may not be
motivated to learn more. Conversely, moderate amounts
of disappointment or frustration may be significant drivers
of effort.
What is important is for emotions to be well-regulated.
A meta-analysis found that the ability to understand and
regulate one’s emotions is a good predictor of academic
performance (MacCann et al., 2020). A systematic review
found that some social and emotional factors, particularly
self-regulation, were more significant than intelligence
in predicting academic achievement (Costa and Fleith,
2019). However, few studies have examined multiple
variables at the same time. Fluid intelligence, emotional
skills and relational personality traits independently
affected learning in a small study in Brazil (Castro
et al., 2021), one of the few that jointly analysed these
factors. A multidimensional understanding of emotions
is important for pedagogic practice, but measurement
difficulties mean that research evidence is stronger for
the effect on learning of discrete basic emotions
(Eliot and Hirumi, 2019), such as fear or anger.
Concern for emotions in the classroom is as relevant
in high- as in low-income settings (Muwonge et al.,
2018). A large meta-analysis of studies across 17 African
countries found social and emotional skills to be
associated with better education and higher earnings
(Ajayi et al., 2022). Social and emotional learning is
particularly relevant in emergency contexts (UNESCO,
2019). The Inter-agency Network for Education in
Emergencies has developed a Psychosocial Support
and Social and Emotional Learning Toolbox to support
education needs in crisis settings (INEE, 2022).
Learners’ emotions concern not only themselves
and the learning content, but also their relationships
with classroom peers, teachers and the wider school
community. Social learning theory emphasizes the role
of social relationships in enabling or hindering learning.
Promoting an inclusive school climate that fosters a feeling
of belonging in all school community members contributes
to successful learning outcomes. Students who feel safer
are more engaged (Côté-Lussier and Fitzpatrick, 2016).
Particularly in the past two decades, the notion that
emotions matter for learning has been supported by
research that has taken advantage of rapid advances in
neuroimaging. Measurements of local blood flow or electric
activity highlight which parts of the brain are activated
during certain tasks and in response to certain stimuli and
how the brain’s structure adapts (Immordino-Yang and
Fischer, 2010). Refined imaging techniques are providing

clearer views into how the brain functions and learns
(Tan and Amiel, 2019). Brain imaging is now used to study
not only neurological correlates of individual cognitive
and non-cognitive factors, but also environmental
factors such as the school climate (Hackman et al., 2022).
Learning literally changes the brain. Such insights based
on neuroscience are increasingly being packaged for
practical classroom use by teachers, for instance in
reframing long-standing practices such as reward and
punishment (O’Mahony, 2020), thus adding nuance to
traditional teacher knowledge about the importance of
learner attitudes.
At the same time, the limitations of neuroscience research
must be understood. Critics say there is a trend of viewing
too broad a range of issues through a neurological lens
in both education and business (Horvath, 2022). Findings
from neuroscience do not translate directly into lessons
for education policy or practice (Aspen Institute, 2019).
Neuroscience research tends to be on adults and involve
laboratory tasks, so its applicability to the classroom may
be limited. While brain imaging can describe the relative
activation of different brain regions in response to certain
stimuli or tasks, this reveals little about actual behaviour
and requires considerable interpretation to make sense
of implications for education (Ansari and Lyons, 2016).
Advocates for neuroscience see it not as providing
definitive answers but as informing the development
of new education theories and research questions
(Immordino-Yang and Gotlieb, 2017).
A further issue is the complexity of transferring
neuroscientific insights into teaching practice, which
requires carefully designed professional development
linked to teachers’ existing knowledge (Tan and Amiel,
2019). Few experts are available to conduct such training
(Elias, 2019). In addition, educators and neuroscientists
‘often hold conflicting views and expectations of both
brain-based learning and of each other’ (Edelenbosch et al.,
2015).
An evidence-based approach with emotional development
at its centre is known as RULER: recognizing,
understanding, labelling, expressing and regulating
emotions. Applied for almost 20 years in the
United States, it has been adopted by more than
2,000 schools, including in other high- and middle-income
countries. In addition to integrating social and emotional
learning into the curriculum, its implementation model
adopts a community-wide approach, with training for
school leaders, teachers and school staff, as well as
systematic engagement with families (Brackett et al.,
2019).

THEORIES OF SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING
INFORM EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY

MONITORING OF SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING
INTENTIONS AND OUTCOMES IS LACKING

The discussions above on social and emotional learning
have implications for learning technology
(Howard-Jones et al., 2015) (Chapter 4). Understanding
learners’ emotional response to learning processes is
particularly important in online learning environments
(Xianglin et al., 2022). Education technology can make
use of the connection between affect and cognition to
motivate users. Computer game designers have long tried
to find the right degree of difficulty and challenge, not to
optimize learning outcomes but to ensure that games
are motivating (or even addictive) (Parkin, 2017). Beyond
motivation, emotions such as surprise and pride are used
consciously in game-like and other education technology.
Incorporating emotional design (e.g. using colours or
shapes aligned with emotions) into materials such as
electronic textbooks sometimes results in improved
learning outcomes. However, the evidence is mixed overall
(Chang and Chen, 2022).

No systematic cross-country data exist on patterns in the
teaching of non-cognitive, social and emotional content.
Some surveys and assessments, however, contain teacher
or student reports on their social and emotional learning or
their social and emotional state with respect to learning.

Education technology can make use of the
connection between affect and cognition to
motivate users
Because of the social nature of learning, one main difficulty
learners encounter is that, unlike when face to face with
another person, they may struggle to anticipate and
understand a computer’s reactions and the reasons for
them (Immordino-Yang and Singh, 2011). Making computer
programs’ goals and motivations transparent could reduce
frustration and improve the ‘social’ relationship between
learners and education technology.
Education technology can try to actively recognize and
monitor learners’ emotions (Gottardo and Pimentel, 2018;
Wang et al., 2014). This would help it intelligently adapt
and, for example, give appropriate feedback
(Grawemeyer et al., 2017). Early attempts at determining
learner emotions were based on intrusive measurement
of biophysical variables, such as heart rate, blood pressure
and brain activity (Shen et al., 2009), or on devices, such
as posture-sensing chairs. More recent attempts to gauge
engagement or boredom use other tools, including gaze
detection (Jaques et al., 2014; Grawemeyer et al., 2017).
While early efforts were directed at eliciting positive
emotional responses to education technology, it is
now being recognized that negative and ambivalent
emotions can positively affect student learning. Teacher
disappointment, for instance, expressed or signalled
through body language or tone, can serve an important
pedagogical function (Dobrosovestnova and
Hannibal, 2020).

283

C H A P T E R 1 8 • E S D and G C E D

A mapping exercise was carried out on the breadth
of skills in 152 countries’ education mission or vision
statements, policy documents, or curricula. It showed that
the four most commonly mentioned skills were creativity,
communication, problem-solving and critical thinking;
each was mentioned by between 45 and 61 countries
(Roth et al., 2017). Affective skills, such as emotion
regulation, appeared less frequently. Peruvian education
policy identifies a need for learners to demonstrate
‘self-esteem and autonomy, in favour of their own
physical and emotional well-being’. The 2015 Revised
National Curriculum in the Republic of Korea includes
self-management competency and aesthetic-emotional
competency among skills to be acquired. Overall, a broad
range of skills was included in 76% of countries’ policy
documents but in less than half of countries’ curricula.
The most ambitious large-scale, cross-national effort
to assess individual social and emotional learning is the
OECD’s Survey on Social and Emotional Skills. Its main
data collection took place in 2019 in 10 cities: Bogota
(Colombia), Daegu (Republic of Korea), Helsinki (Finland),
Houston (United States), Istanbul (Türkiye), Manizales
(Colombia), Moscow (Russian Federation), Ottawa
(Canada), Sintra (Portugal) and Suzhou (China). The survey
assessed three skills for each of the ‘big five’ personality
domains (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness and neuroticism), plus two additional skills:
self-efficacy and achievement motivation (OECD, 2021).
The study assessed 10- and 15-year-olds. It revealed
a dip in social and emotional skills in adolescence. Both
developmental and school factors may play a role.
The survey also found that while gender differences in
emotional control were minimal at age 10, the gender
gap had grown considerably by age 15: boys experienced
a similar level of emotional control as the younger group,
but girls experienced much lower emotional control at
age 15. Often this translates into lower emotional
well-being. Teachers in secondary school thus continue to
play an important role in identifying signs of distress and
require training to support students.

In addition to skills assessment, the survey collected
self-reported information from teachers on the extent
to which social and emotional learning development was
institutionalized in their training and at their schools
(Figure 18.2). About half of teachers in most cities
strongly agreed that they had experienced such training
opportunities, although only around a quarter did so in
Helsinki and Ottawa. About 9 in 10 teachers reported
promoting social and emotional learning in their general
practice. Dedicated social and emotional learning classes
or activities were reported by between 43% (Sintra)
and 82% (Suzhou) of teachers.
A slightly broader set of skills than that covered in the
Survey on Social and Emotional Skills was included in
data collection for the 2021 Programme for International
Student Assessment, which was postponed to 2022 due

to the COVID-19 pandemic and whose results are not yet
available. A module of the context questionnaire on general
social and emotional characteristics contains a set of items
on ‘student beliefs, attitudes, feelings, and behaviours’,
including emotional control (Bertling and Alegre, 2019).
To conclude, evidence from neuroimaging aligns with
teachers’ experience indicating that social and emotional
factors and skills strongly affect classroom learning.
This means it is as crucial in traditional classrooms as in
technology-heavy learning environments to ensure that
learners’ emotions contribute to learning rather than
inhibiting it. Unfortunately, few systematic international
data are collected on which social and emotional skills
learners have and if or how these are fostered at school.

KE Y MESSAGES
Most school infrastructure indicators were either stable or improved only slowly between 2015 and 2020. But more
schools have been connected to electricity, with the share over the period rising from 66% to 76% in primary and from
77% to 86% in lower secondary education.
Over 20% of primary schools in Central and Southern Asia and in Eastern and South-eastern Asia lack functional
single-sex bathrooms, as do 83% in Mali and 94% in Togo.
The 2022 Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack report found that attacks on education and military use
of schools and universities increased in 2020–21 from 2018–19, notably in Mali and Myanmar.
Technology can help protect buildings from natural disasters. Schools built to Peru’s new codes withstood the Pisco
earthquake far better than older schools. During the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, retrofitted school buildings largely
remained intact.
Solar power technology can help accelerate school electrification. Of 31 countries where more than half of primary
schools are without electricity, 28 have above global average solar power potential.
The share of school trips made in private vehicles is almost 55% in the United States. Various types of technology
can help make public transport to and from school smoother, safer, more efficient and more equitable. In the United
States, a 2021 law provided for investment of USD 5 billion in low- and zero-emission school buses over five years.

afe, welcoming environments are essential for effective
learning and should be available to all. Target 4.a
responds to this call by covering a range of both facilityand environment-related indicators that monitor student
safety and well-being.
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) global indicator
4.a.1 focuses on infrastructure. New technologies
can help improve school construction, though many
challenges remain (Focus 19.1). One of the most important
infrastructures for gender equality is the availability
of single-sex sanitation facilities, meaning separate
bathrooms for males and females, which is often a
prerequisite for girls to attend school because of concerns
over their safety (Levy and Houston, 2017). Over 20% of
primary schools in Central and Southern Asia and in
Eastern and South-eastern Asia lack functional single-sex
bathrooms; in Mali and Togo, they are lacking in 83% and
94% of schools, respectively.

Single-sex bathrooms are more common in secondary than
in primary schools. In Burundi, for example, 35% of primary
and 100% of upper secondary schools had single-sex
bathrooms in 2018. But this might be too late for some
girls, given very high levels of over-age enrolment, as in
2018 when 31% of primary school students were at least
2 years over-age for their grade. A lack of menstrual
hygiene facilities, stigma and stress lead to many girls
missing up to one week of school a month, increasing the
chances of falling behind and dropping out (UNICEF, 2023b).
A lower share of primary schools with single-sex
bathrooms is associated with a higher out-of-school
rate for girls than for boys in upper secondary education
(Figure 19.1). This negative relationship may also reflect
broader gender bias patterns. In Afghanistan, the lack of
single-sex bathrooms in three quarters of primary schools
in 2018 may have been indicative of an overall lack of
priority for gender equality in education, even before the
Taliban takeover in 2021 (Save the Children, 2022).

Without electricity, students and teachers cannot
use information and communication technology (ICT)
in schools. Indicator 4.a.1, which monitors the availability
of computers and internet for pedagogical purposes,
shows that in many countries, a considerable number of
schools have only one or the other (Figure 19.3). Usually,
the share of schools with computers exceeds that of
schools with internet. In Turkmenistan for example, nearly
all primary schools have a computer, but only 31% of them
have internet. But in a few countries, the opposite is
true: in Lebanon and Maldives, over 90% of schools have
internet for teaching and learning, but only some 70% have
a computer.

The Giga initiative, which was launched in 2019 with
the goal of connecting every school to the internet,
has mapped schools and their real-time connectivity
levels in 45 countries by combining national data sources
with machine learning and satellite images (Giga, 2023b).
It has provided location details for 7,000 schools to the
government of Colombia to improve planning (Giga, 2023a).
In Brazil, a national initiative to map school connectivity
launched in 2021, Mapa Integrado de Conectividade na
Educação (Integrated Map of Education Connectivity),
and allowed policymakers to analyse whether connectivity
in schools was lower than in nearby residential and
commercial buildings, in order to facilitate contract
renegotiations with providers (CIEB, 2021).
But increased internet access also poses threats to
students. Cyberbullying has become a global phenomenon.
Indicator 4.a.2 measures the percentage of students
who experienced bullying in the past 12 months based on
cross-national health and learning achievement surveys.
Among the latter, the 2019 Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) asked grade
4 and grade 8 students about online bullying. In nearly all

participating countries, at least 10% of grade 4 students
had experienced cyberbullying in the past year, defined
as having received ‘nasty or hurtful messages’, ‘nasty
or hurtful things’ or ‘embarrassing photos’ online
(Figure 19.4). The share of students who have experienced
cyberbullying is even higher among grade 8 students:
over 20% of students in 26 out of the 32 countries with
available data.
Cyberbullying tends to be higher in countries with an
overall high prevalence of bullying. In Latvia and
South Africa, where 30% and 50% of students experienced
cyberbullying, respectively, around 90% of students
experienced some type of bullying. Indeed, bullying is a
common experience in most countries, especially for boys.
In almost every one of the 116 countries with available
data, more than a quarter of students experienced bullying.
Boys reported having been bullied more often than girls
did in 83 of those 116 countries (UNESCO, 2023).

Various types of technologies can help
make commuting safer and more efficient
but conflict continues to put students and
teachers at grave risk
In addition to students’ well-being and safety within
schools, SDG target 4.a. also recognizes that schools must
be safe to reach. Various types of technologies can help
make commuting safer and more efficient (Focus 19.3).
But conflict continues to put students and teachers at
grave risk of various dangers, including gang violence,

as in Haiti (Box 19.1). Indicator 4.a.3 monitors the number
of attacks on schools and higher education; military use
of schools and universities; and attacks on students,
teachers and personnel inside or outside of schools. It also
counts incidents of child recruitment or sexual violence
perpetrated in schools or along school routes. Data for this
indicator are compiled by the Global Coalition to Protect
Education from Attack (GCPEA), through three main
methods: reviews of relevant reports, media searches
and outreach to GCPEA members. The 2022 GCPEA report
found that attacks on education and the military use of
schools and universities increased in 2020–21 compared
to 2018–19, notably in Mali and Myanmar (Figure 19.5).
The number of students and teachers harmed, however,
decreased (GCPEA, 2022).

B OX 19.1:

Armed violence is severely disrupting education in Haiti
Gang violence has skyrocketed in Haiti since the assassination of former president Jovenel Moïse in 2021. It is estimated that up to
200 armed groups operate in the capital Port-au-Prince and control 60% of the city, forcing many to flee their homes and many children
to leave school (Murrin, 2022; UNICEF, 2023a). Between October 2022 and February 2023, 72 schools were targeted, compared to 8 in
the previous year. Acts of violence against and at schools include shootings, kidnappings, looting of school equipment, and stealing
ingredients used for school meals (UNICEF, 2023a). Gangs have also recruited students, often forcefully, or have taken control of schools,
forcing school directors to pay for safety (UNICEF, 2022a).
Principals pre-emptively close schools to protect children during periods of increased violence or social unrest (UNICEF, 2023a). In April
2022, 1,700 schools were closed in Port-au-Prince alone due to increased violence, keeping half a million children out of school (Murrin,
2022). Moreover, many schools close because they are occupied by displaced families (UNICEF, 2022a). Overall, one in four schools stayed
closed from October 2022 until at least March 2023 (Alonso, 2023).
As a result, children’s education has been severely disrupted. At least 10,000 grade 9 students were unable to take the official end-ofyear exams in 2022 because of gang violence (Joseph, 2022). In January 2023 alone, children lost on average 1.5 school days per week.
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) predicted they would lose about 36 days between January and the end of June 2023 if
violence continues (UNICEF, 2023a).

FOCUS 19.1: SCHOOL BUILDINGS
HAVE AMPLE TECHNOLOGY
Schooling does not require a building, but buildings such
as tents and temporary structures can provide ventilation,
hygiene facilities and shelter from the natural elements.
Appropriate technology can help improve the safety,
sustainability, efficiency and speed of school construction.
There is no shortage of sustainable building materials
for schools, including wood, bamboo and mud bricks
(Robles et al., 2015). In India, school walls are built from
‘bricks’ made of used plastic water bottles filled with
sand (Manjarekar, 2019). Prototype schools in Malawi
were constructed at one quarter the cost of a conventional
school by using locally sourced timber and soil blocks,
allowing lighting and ventilation without electricity
(Arup, 2023). Materials technology has also provided
non-toxic alternatives to water pipes and paint containing
lead, and fireproofing containing asbestos.

Innovation may be in the building technique as
much as the materials
Innovation may be in the building technique as much as
the materials. In Malawi, a single-classroom school for
50 students was 3D-printed in less than a day using
concrete ‘ink’ that is less energy- and carbon-intensive
than standard construction methods. Another pilot

291

school was printed in Madagascar (Matchar, 2021).
In Europe, the first 3D-printed schools may appear as
part of the reconstruction efforts in Ukraine (Hanaphy,
2022). However, the high cost of 3D-printing equipment
currently constrains the parallel construction of multiple
sites (Pensulo, 2021). Historically, innovations in school
construction have not matched proven methods such as
reinforced concrete (Theunynck, 2009).
An exception is emergency settings, which require
modularity, mobility and rapid deployment not offered
by conventional, permanent construction. In Türkiye,
UNICEF procured 300 modular container classrooms
to accommodate 60,000 Syrian refugee children.
In Bangladesh, UNICEF supported the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Disaster Management
and Relief with the construction of learning centres from
bamboo and sungrass (UNICEF, 2022b). Geodesic domes
are an ingenious way of assembling thin-shelled
dome-shaped structures out of a lattice of interconnected
rods or bars that can withstand strong forces even when
made out of relatively light or flexible materials. Because
they are easy to transport and quick to set up, they are
suitable for providing emergency shelter and schooling
spaces in crisis situations (Friedrich Naumann Foundation,
2016; Solardome 2023).
Classrooms can also be produced by converting shipping
containers or similar prefabricated modules. In the
United States, an industry survey in 2012 showed that
some 5 million students were taught in 280,000 trailer

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.a.1
Global indicator 4.a.1 measures the proportion of schools with access to seven different infrastructure and resource dimensions:
electricity, internet, computers, drinking water, handwashing facilities, single-sex bathrooms, and adapted infrastructure and materials
for students with disabilities.
Most of these indicators have either remained stable or only slowly improved between 2015 and 2020 (Figure 19.6). However, there are
some exceptions. The share of schools with adapted infrastructure and materials for students with disabilities increased at all levels of
education, and most significantly in upper secondary from 46% in 2015 to 56% in 2020. Electricity has also been on the rise, from 66% to
76% in primary and from 77% to 86% in lower secondary education.

classrooms (Baker, 2014). They made up 30% of all
available classroom space in the Los Angeles Unified
School District (Clough, 2015). While adequate in the
short term, challenges arise when such structures end
up being used indefinitely (Inside Science, 2009).
Temporary structures are often used as a way to
circumvent rules and regulations on air quality and
other standards that apply to standard school buildings
(Profita, 2014).

construction is beneficial in the case of an earthquake,
but more vulnerable to damage from high winds
(Arup International Development, 2013). In 2007,
schools built to Peru’s new codes withstood the
Pisco earthquake far better than older schools
(Bastidas and Petal, 2012). Similarly, during the
2015 earthquake in Nepal, 7,000 schools were
destroyed or damaged (GFDRR, 2015), but retrofitted
school buildings largely remained intact (ADB, 2015).

Technology can also help protect buildings from
natural disasters, which frequently destroy or damage
schools (Table 19.1). Suitable construction, adapted to
the most prevalent hazards in a given school location,
makes a difference. For instance, lightweight timber

Technological innovations can alleviate other safety and
well-being concerns. Some governments have taken
steps to improve the ventilation of classrooms, an issue
that became prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

installation of air cleaning systems and air quality sensors
in classrooms, which can then be monitored by parents
and school councils (Arin, 2019). Technology has also
helped improve acoustic design and sound insulation
(Shield and Richardson, 2018), which can prevent
disturbances and improve long-term health
(Klatte et al., 2013). In Florida, schools moving from
non-compliant to new compliant buildings saw an
increase in scores and pass rates on standardized
tests (Lumpkin et al., 2014).
Finally, technology can help optimize school construction
planning. For example, 3D laser scanning can support
modelling to inform sustainable refurbishment by
efficiently capturing detailed information on the physical

293

shape and dimensions of school buildings (Le, 2021).
Virtual reality technology has been used to simulate
fire emergency evacuations from a school building,
taking into account the spread of fire and smoke as well
as the dynamic movement of students and teachers
(Cimellaro et al., 2019; Lorusso et al., 2022). Such studies
can inform new school construction, the adaptation
of existing buildings and the design of escape routes.
Agent-based modelling, i.e. computer simulations used to
study the interactions among people, things, places and
time, can give insights into preventing stampede risks in
emergencies by optimizing the design and placement of
stairs and toilets in primary schools (Xie, 2018).

FOCUS 19.2: CAN SOLAR POWER CLOSE
THE SCHOOL ELECTRIFICATION GAP?
Large numbers of schools in low- and middle-income
countries, especially primary schools, do not have
electricity. Investment into large-scale infrastructure
for expanding the electricity grid is an obvious but costly
solution. Decentralized electric power generation offers
an alternative, where the electricity consumed by the
school is generated close by. This is not a new concept:
diesel-powered generators have long been used for
remote hospitals and schools, but they rely on the delivery
of heavy fuel and therefore do not create true electricity
independence (Jiménez and Lawand, 2000). More recently,
PV electricity generation, i.e. solar panels that turn sunlight
into an electric current, have created new options for
decentralized power generation.
The first known deployment of a solar panel
to a primary school occurred in Niger in 1968
(Sovacool and Ryan, 2016). In the Brazilian state of
Minas Gerais, the large-scale rural school electrification
programme Luz no Saber (Light in Knowledge) provided
solar power to some 1,000 of the most remote schools
between 1995 and 2005 (Diniz et al., 2006).
As with many technologies, however, the revolutionary
potential of PV electricity generation was triggered
not when it first became available, but when it became
affordable. This has occurred in the last 10 years.
The global average price of solar panels dropped
88% between 2010 and 2021, from USD 0.42 per kWh to
USD 0.05 per kWh (IRENA, 2022); prices for large-scale PV
projects in Africa are even lower (IRENA, 2016). These price
drops are partly due to the higher efficiency of modern
PV panels, and partly to technological progress in the
manufacturing process. Moreover, auxiliary technologies
have matured, such as battery technology for buffering
fluctuations and smart algorithms for managing local grids
with many independent power inputs.

The global average price of solar panels
dropped 88% between 2010 and 2021
The feasibility of solar solutions for electricity generation
is illustrated by their rapid adoption in Africa. Between
2010 and 2019, the number of people in Africa connected
to solar minigrids increased 45-fold from only 39,000 to
1,736,000 (IRENA, 2021). Schools lacking electricity are
concentrated in climate zones with high solar potential
(Figure 19.7). Among the 31 countries where more than
half of all primary schools are without electricity, only

three – Congo, Liberia and Nepal – have an average PV
power potential below the global average. Among all
countries with primary schools that are not electrified,
the theoretical PV potential of even the least sunny,
Bhutan, is still one third higher than in the Netherlands,
which has the second-highest installed solar PV capacity
per capita after Australia (IEA, 2022). Climate change may
change current patterns of average cloud coverage and
solar panels are less efficient at higher temperatures.
However, even taking these factors into account, the solar
potential in Africa is not projected to diminish due to
climate change (Soares et al., 2019).
However, being located in a favourable climate zone
is not enough. Sophisticated technical and economic
analyses and optimization are required for the design of
a feasible system, taking into account factors such as
the site and buildings, solar radiation, load profiles, cost
and the lifetime of components (Chatterjee et al., 2018;
Endaylalu, 2018). Across Indian states and territories,
the percentage of schools with solar power is highest in
Chandigarh and Delhi, two of the richest and most urban
territories in the country. This suggests that PV technology
for school electrification is still driven by local technical and
investment capacity potential.
Barriers to large-scale electrification of schools include
upfront costs, procurement, vandalism and theft
(Sovacool and Ryan, 2016). Perhaps due to such
challenges, as well as a scarcity of trained technicians
for maintenance, some large-scale policies for solar
electrification of schools in the early to mid-2010s did
not meet their objectives. In Papua New Guinea,
a solar lighting programme for rural schools equipped
2,400 classrooms, but a lack of maintenance meant
‘only a handful of units’ were still operating five years
later (Sovacool and Ryan, 2016).
It may be crucial for the sustainability of projects to ensure
that the wider community benefits from solar installations
at schools. Part of the problem in Papua New Guinea was
that solar panels installed at schools were frequently
vandalized or stolen because their exclusive benefit to the
school did not align with local understandings of common
property rights (Sovacool and Ryan, 2016). A promising –
but challenging – approach is to integrate school and
community electrification in the form of microgrids
(Kirchhoff et al., 2016), local electrical grids with defined
electrical boundaries, acting as single and controllable
entities. But school electrification can be designed to
also benefit households even without microgrids. Under
the award-winning Solar Cow initiatives, students take
portable batteries to school and charge them during the
school day (Chang, 2021). The batteries are sufficient to

charge mobile phones and power lights and a radio at
home. Pilot programmes in Kenya and the United Republic
of Tanzania are benefiting 550 households, and the
initiative plans to expand to the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Indonesia and Rwanda.
Finally, technologies that allow schools to exploit solar
energy can provide benefits besides electricity. Direct
exposure to solar UV radiation is surprisingly effective
at disinfecting water (Schulte, 2011). Sunlight can be
captured for heating school buildings through
technologies that optimize window area and design
against insulation (Liu, 2018). Solar energy can even
be used for cooling. Besides electric air conditioning
powered by photovoltaics, ‘solar thermal’ or ‘solar
thermo-mechanical’ systems use solar energy to directly
cool classrooms (Aguilar-Jiménez, 2020).

FOCUS 19.3: TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS
THE SCHOOL COMMUTE
The means by which children and adolescents get to school
does not follow a predictable relationship with countries’
economic development (Figure 19.8). In the United States,
according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey,
almost 55% of school trips were made in private vehicles,
35% on school buses, public transport or ‘other’, and 10%
on foot or bicycle (Pfledderer et al., 2021). This pattern is
mirrored in Abu Dhabi and Colombo. In contrast, in Dar es
Salaam, 60% of school trips are made by walking or cycling,
37% by public transport and only 3% by car or motorcycle.
Similar patterns are observed in Hyderabad, India, and
across Czechia.

Various types of technology can help make public
transportation to and from school smoother, safer,
more efficient and more equitable. In the United States,
a 2021 law established an investment of USD 5 billion
for low- and zero-emission school buses to be spent
over five years (Beierle, 2022). In Yogyakarta, Indonesia,
the most important barriers to bus use were travel
time, long distances to the nearest stop and a lack of
100routes. Technological approaches to encourage
direct
greater bus use among students include the provision of
Wi-Fi90connections on buses, and geographic positioning
systems (GPS) tracking to provide real-time information
80
on arrival times (Yumita et al., 2021). In Brazil, the national
funding
70 programme for improving school routes included
resources for improving public school boats – a mode of
transportation
used by 300,000 children in the Amazon
60
region. Using technological innovations for optimizing their
50
hull shape
has been estimated to generate substantial
cost savings, in addition to environmental benefits

(Hernández-Fontes et al., 2021).

The introduction of digital geographic information systems
(GIS) into education planning has allowed for detailed
analyses of school distribution and transportation
networks. In Singapore, a large-scale experiment
collected high-frequency ‘crowd-sensed’ geolocation and
environmental data from students equipped with a special
mobile device. An analysis showed the high complexity of
school routing, with most students having between 6 and
52 different potential pickup locations. Based on the data,
a last-mile shuttle service was designed by algorithmic
optimization that would save most students more than
20% travel time (Panrong et al., 2021).

Technological developments can help address some
of these cycling challenges. Since 2005, World Bicycle
Relief has distributed over 600,000 purpose-built bikes
for rugged terrain in different programme locations,
including Colombia, Indonesia and Zimbabwe
(World Bicycle Relief, 2022). A rigorous evaluation of their
partnership with Zambia’s Ministry of Education pointed
to improvements in absenteeism, dropout rates and
learning (Fiala et al., 2022). The First African Bicycle
Information Organization launched an electronic
bike, an e-bike, designed specifically for the needs of
sub-Saharan Africa: low-price, but especially robust
(with reinforced frames and spokes), chargeable with solar
energy, and with non-electric components that can be
repaired with local spare parts (FABIO, 2022).
Moreover, a cost–benefit analysis of e-bikes and
conversion kits in the United Republic of Tanzania
concluded that students would save money compared to
bus fares on a recurrent basis (excluding the initial cost
of purchase) and save students over three hours per day
compared to walking or riding buses in congested urban
traffic. A conversion kit for an existing mechanical bike
can be obtained for under USD 100, compared to
USD 450 to 600 for a complete e-bike (Greyson et al.,
2021), around half of the average Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita.

Cycling to school is an active and environmentally friendly
alternative, though its prevalence varies widely across
countries. Traffic safety and poor road conditions are
major concerns (Idei et al., 2020; Tetali et al., 2015).
In sub-Saharan Africa, most primary schools are not
accessible via a paved road (Figure 19.9).

40

D. R. Congo

Technology can also help encourage children to walk or
cycle to school, and their caregivers to allow them to do
so. GIS has been used to identify the safest walking or
cycling routes to a given school, for instance by
mapping road accidents and identifying ‘hot spots’ to
avoid. Mobile phones and GPS tracking may provide
reassurance to families (Samah et al., 2019;
Sute et al., 2019; Sweeney and Hagen, 2016),
whether used to monitor children’s commute in real
time, for children to send a confirmation upon arrival,
or merely ‘just in case’. Other examples include
app-based gamification of the school commute
(Coombes and Jones, 2016; Kazhamiakin et al., 2021;
Marconi et al., 2018) and swipe card technology at
checkpoints along walking routes that make it feasible for
schools to support students walking to school without
continuous location tracking (Hunter et al., 2015).

KE Y MESSAGES
In 2020, over USD 4.4 billion was disbursed in scholarships and imputed student costs, an increase of USD 1.3 billion,
or 42%, since 2015. However, scholarship disbursements declined in 2020 and 2021 by 24%, likely attributable to the
global impact of COVID-19: Scholarship money may have been available but not disbursed as student movements
were restricted.

In 2020, only 11% of scholarships and imputed student costs were related to low-income countries, compared with
76% to middle-income countries.
Globally, the number of outbound international students tripled between 2000 and 2020, a greater increase than
that observed for students from sub-Saharan and Northern Africa (2.2 times) and small island developing states
(SIDS) (1.5 times).
By far the most common destination for students from these regions is Northern America and Western Europe,
which accounts for over 70% of students from SIDS and Northern Africa and 48% of students from sub-Saharan
Africa. The second most common destination for students from sub-Saharan Africa is the region itself, accounting for
20% of outbound international students.
Students’ online searches for international scholarships reveal a period of stability over 2010–19, followed by a
visible, if moderate, drop in early 2020 in response to COVID-19 uncertainty and travel restrictions. Since then there
has been a sharp increase, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

he Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 4.b
deadline was 2020, unlike most other targets in the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By 2020,
over USD 4.4 billion was disbursed in scholarships and
imputed student costs (Box 20.1), an increase of
USD 1.3 billion, or 42%, since 2015 (Figure 20.1).
By contrast, scholarships and imputed student costs
remained relatively stable between 2010 and 2015.
However, funds declined in 2020 and 2021 as a result of
a 24% drop in scholarships, from USD 1.7 billion in 2019 to
USD 1.3 billion in 2021. This drop is likely attributable to
the global impact of COVID-19: money for scholarships
may have been available but not disbursed due to
restrictions on student movement. Imputed student costs
continued to grow, although they tapered off in 2021.
Such disbursements for scholarships and imputed student
costs are recorded only by those countries which choose
to do so under the official development assistance (ODA)
budget. But not all countries choose to do so – and the
amount recorded does not include scholarships by private
providers.

Scholarships and imputed costs: An important
distinction
Official development assistance (ODA) flows for scholarships
comprise two parts. Direct scholarships are a form of financial
aid awarded to individual students for full-time studies in
higher education institutions which charge fees at the point
of study. Imputed student costs refer to support provided
to students in countries with non-fee charging educational
institutions (OECD, 2019). It is important to acknowledge
imputed student costs as a form of scholarship because
otherwise the indirect cost of students studying in non-fee
charging systems would be overlooked.
Both direct scholarships and imputed student costs can
be reported as ODA if: (a) students are from ODA-eligible
countries; and (b) the costs are recognized in official budgets
with appropriate involvement from the authorities responsible
for ODA programmes. Scholarships and traineeships, even
though they are primarily awarded for studies in the provider
country and do not involve fund transfers to ODA-eligible
countries, are recorded in the balance of payments as a
cross-border flow. This is because they represent a resource
transfer between residents and non-residents. This treatment
also applies to imputed student costs, where the absence
of fees paid by students is considered a ‘travel credit’ in
the balance of payments. The current ODA definition only
recognizes the international flow from the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and from non-DAC
donors to developing countries. A new definition is being
developed that will also allow flows to be recognized between
developing countries.
This distinction poses a challenge for how to interpret data.
It is unclear what proportion of scholarships helps students
study abroad and what proportion helps students study
in their home countries. By definition, imputed student
costs are purely for those studying abroad. OECD Creditor
Reporting System microdata offer some insights. In 2021,
Germany, the largest contributor to imputed student costs,
reported spending USD 336 million for Chinese students,
USD 103 million for Iranian students and USD 30 million for
Brazilian students. France allocated USD 26 million to support
students from Côte d'Ivoire. Scholarship programmes tend
for have smaller budgets and reach fewer beneficiaries. For
instance, Saudi Arabia granted scholarships and training to
271 Nigerian students, for a value of USD 3.6 million. Portugal
sponsored senior officials from Brazil in Portugal with
USD 6.2 million, while Hungary dedicated USD 3.6 million to
Brazilians to study at Hungarian tertiary institutions.

20

The longer-term trend since 2015 of funds increasing has
mainly been the result of two factors. First, bilateral flows
with unspecified recipient countries increased, driven by
European Union (EU) institutions and Japan, which started
reporting all its scholarship aid under this category in
2017. Second, imputed student costs largely related to
refugee flows to Germany also increased after 2015 and
refugee students were eligible for entry into the country’s
essentially free tertiary education system.

It is important to chart not only the scale of disbursements,
but also where they are directed to. In 2020, only 11% of
scholarships and imputed student costs were disbursed to
low-income countries, compared to 76% to middle-income
countries (Figure 20.2). However, low-income countries
have benefited more in relative terms. Scholarships and
imputed student costs disbursed doubled in 2015–20,
more than for the other income groups.
In 2014, the year before the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) came into effect, China was the single largest
recipient of scholarships and imputed student costs of
USD 371 million, 13% of the global total, or over 3 times
more than the second largest recipient, India, and 1.7 times
more than all low-income countries combined. By 2021,
China was still the largest recipient, with USD 392 million;
however, this amount now accounted for just 9% of the
total and was less than the disbursements to low-income
countries (USD 491 million).

Target 4.b calls for a substantial increase in aid to
support student mobility, particularly for those in the
‘least developed countries, small island developing
states, and African countries’. The number of outbound
international students from these countries has
continuously increased for the past two decades.
Globally, the number of outbound international students
tripled between 2000 and 2020, a greater increase
than that observed for students from sub-Saharan and
Northern Africa (2.2 times) and small island developing
states (SIDS) (1.5 times) (Figure 20.3a). Still, outbound
mobility has increased more slowly than their national

tertiary programmes. The ratio of outbound international
students to the total tertiary enrolment in countries has
decreased in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000, although it
has been growing among the least developed countries
group since 2012 and for SIDS since 2008 (Figure 20.3b).
The most common destination for students from these
regions is, by far, Northern America and Western Europe,
which account for almost 75% of students from SIDS and
Northern Africa (Figure 20.4). Regional distribution is less
concentrated for students from sub-Saharan Africa, only
48% of whom go to Northern America and Western Europe.
The second most common destination for students from
sub-Saharan Africa is the region itself, accounting for
20% of outbound international students. South Africa is
the most popular destination in the region, having received
nearly 30,000 students from other sub-Saharan countries
in 2020.
Although the SDG target aims to reduce inequality in
access, there is also a risk of exacerbating disparities
by targeting countries instead of individuals. This is
because scholarship beneficiaries tend to have privileged
backgrounds and they may not contribute to the economic
development of their home countries (Box 20.2).

B OX 20.2 :

A government-sponsored scholarship programme in
Brazil did not lead to expected results

Studies analysing the impact of the Ciência sem Fronteiras
programme highlight its many shortcomings. First, there are
criticisms that it mostly benefited students from privileged
backgrounds, who came from the country’s most prestigious
universities and richest states. This inequity was compounded
by the programme’s requirement that students speak a foreign
language (Feltrin et al., 2021; Moreno, 2014). Second, the
programme’s rushed implementation led to significant flaws in
the design: a lack of quality control of the foreign universities;
lack of compatibility between courses, which meant students
often could not use any of the credits completed abroad; and lack
of sufficient foreign language knowledge leading to premature
student return to Brazil (Fabiano, 2014; Moreno, 2014; SBPC,
2017). A programme evaluation after six years confirmed that
it did not achieve its goals of increasing student participation in
master’s or doctoral programmes, in the formal labour market, or
as entrepreneurs (Conceição et al., 2023).

In 2011, the Brazilian government launched Ciência sem
Fronteiras (Science without Borders), a scholarship programme
for tertiary students in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics fields to pursue a fully funded academic year
abroad. The programme was originally focused on bachelor’s
students, who received nearly 80% of the scholarships in the first
six years, but the programme ended in 2017. During those six
years, the government issued more than 100,000 scholarships at
a cost of over BRL 15 billion (USD 3 billion), 15 times more than
the total budget of the country’s National Council for Scientific
and Technological Development (Conceição et al., 2023; SBPC,
2017). Note that such programmes have not been counting
towards the achievement of SDG target 4.b, as progress has
been measured exclusively on the basis of OECD DAC aid terms.

Nonetheless, the programme did succeed in increasing
the number of Brazilian tertiary students studying abroad
(Figure 20.5). There are some indications that the programme
increased international collaboration among researchers for
publications and increased partnerships between Brazilian and
foreign tertiary institutions, although much of this may have
resulted from scholarships provided to master’s and doctoral
students (Manços and Coelho, 2017).

FOCUS 20.1: WHAT DO ONLINE
SEARCHES REVEAL ABOUT INTEREST IN
INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS?
More and more people rely on the internet for an
increasing number of activities, including those related to
work and education. Accordingly, insights can be gained
from data collected about these activities. For example,
the rise and fall in the number of people searching online
for flu symptoms might track flu incidence. This premise
has given rise to hundreds of studies using Google Trends
data alone (Jun et al., 2018), just one data source among
many. Studies have employed various forms of online or
mobile phone data, including to estimate macroeconomic
indicators (Narita and Yin, 2018) or small-area illiteracy
estimates in Senegal (Schmid et al., 2017). The 2021 World
Development Report, which focused on data, called for the
use of alternative data sources to monitor public health,
target resources and service delivery, analyse information
not collected by the government (such as access to
financial services), and hold governments accountable,
while noting limitations in terms of representativeness and
risks of discrimination and manipulation more precisely.
Despite a proliferation of research of this nature exploring
questions relating to international development and
migration, hardly any of these studies focus on student
migration and none on international scholarships or
scholarship holders. This seems a missed opportunity to
gain insights into the interest in international scholarships
around the world.

Monitoring scholarships suffers from a lack
of robust data
Monitoring scholarships suffers from a lack of robust data.
There is no consensus on how to provide standardized,
transparently defined and comprehensive information
on the number of international scholarships available to
students from low- and middle-income countries. In the
absence of such standard data, the GEM Report team
has conducted experimental research, albeit with careful
attention to methodology, analysis and interpretation.
The first step to identifying an overseas scholarship
opportunity is often an online search, using general
search engines such as Google or Baidu; their searches
are highly correlated in China, although Baidu accounts
for a vastly higher volume (Vaughan and Chen, 2015).
Specialized scholarship platforms provide an alternative,
or complementary, tool for some students, while

305

C H A P T E R 2 0 • S cholarships

others rely on low-tech information sources, such as
word-of-mouth. Still, patterns of online searches for
international scholarship opportunities using general
search engines may unveil broad trends.
The report team analysed the volume of searches
related to international scholarships on the Google
search engine. Trends in searches for given keywords are
publicly available through the Google Trends portal. What
Google provides is not the absolute number of searches
but search interest relative to a benchmark. For trend
analysis, the benchmark (scaled to an index value of 100)
is the highest number of daily searches during the period
in question. For comparisons between search terms,
the benchmark is the highest among them.
Easy access and the high share of Google in the online
search market are general advantages that explain the
popularity of these data. However, the market share
and representativeness vary greatly across countries.
And while searches in other languages are covered in
principle, in practice only English language searches
provide a sufficient sample size for analysis for many
search terms. Moreover, the underlying data are
proprietary, and the methodological choices are opaque.
Care must be taken with how the data are extracted
and interpreted.
Some patterns are predictable. For example, students
receive their grades and the diplomas they need to
apply for scholarships at specific points in time. Most
scholarships have application deadlines. Even if the
exact timing of these markers differs by country or
even institution, a seasonal pattern could be expected
that repeats each academic year. In 2020 and 2021,
however, a pronounced drop could be predicted, as travel
opportunities were curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is also a recognized fact that international student
mobility is influenced by historic, cultural and especially
linguistic proximity. Accordingly, search interest in
scholarships for study in the United Kingdom could be
assumed to be higher in an anglophone African country
than in its francophone neighbour, for instance.
Indeed, the African countries where ‘international
scholarships UK’ had the highest index value over the past
five years are Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and
Uganda. This contrasts with the equivalent French term
‘bourse en France’, which attracted the most interest in
Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar and
Senegal. Search activity for the United Kingdom–based
Chevening scholarship displays a pronounced period of
heightened interest from approximately June to October,
and drops off precipitously in early November after the
application deadline.

20

More problematic is that it has been observed that
completely unrelated search terms share common trends
in Google Trends data (Bokelmann and Lessmann, 2019),
suggesting spurious patterns driven by changes in overall
search volume or methodological changes. This is reported
to have been the most pronounced in the 2000s, when the
service was relatively new and the online search market
more dynamic. Because of this, the analysis is limited to
the period since 2010.
Trends were analysed for the generic search term
‘international scholarships’ as well as for scholarships in
the United States, Germany as the major non-anglophone
European destination, and emerging destinations such as
China and Turkey (reflecting the country’s name at that
time, prior to its official change to Türkiye). Each series is
normalized independently, meaning that the values are not
directly comparable between series. In particular, it would
be a mistake to interpret the graphs as showing the same
number of searches, when, for example, searches for
Turkey were about half as common as searches for the
United States. At the same scale, destination-agnostic
searches outnumber those specific to the United States as
a destination by a factor of 10, and searches for Turkey as
a scholarship destination by a factor of 100.
For the generic search, a long period of stability can be
seen in 2010–19, followed by a visible, if moderate, drop in
early 2020 in response to COVID-19 uncertainty and travel
restrictions, and by a sharp increase afterwards, even
exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, the most recent
data are difficult to interpret due to changes in Google’s
data collection in early 2022 (Figure 20.6).

Despite these signs that search engine analysis may be
promising, there are several caveats. Google Trends data
themselves fluctuate too much (Fenga, 2020). For example,
identical searches for the same past time period do not
give identical results when conducted on different days
(Cebrián and Domenech, 2022). This is because Google
Trends uses a random sample of internet protocol (IP)
addresses (Böhme, 2020). While this variation may be
large enough to make trend analysis unreliable for short
timescales (Behnen et al., 2020), it is unlikely to influence
the results of looking at large trends over months and
years. All figures display the average search index values
over multiple queries.

For scholarships to the United States, a previous
upward trend reversed following the election of
Donald Trump as US President in 2016. This matches
official data on new international student enrolment, that
increased by 50% from around 200,000 in 2009/10 to
300,000 in 2015/16, but then steadily declined by a total
of 10% up to the academic year that started in autumn
2019 (OpenDoors, 2023). Searches for scholarships in
Turkey increased rapidly from 2010 to 2014 but
declined relatively steadily until 2020 before picking
up again in 2020–21. Searches for China did not recover
from the pandemic decline until now, unlike for
traditional destinations.

An alternative to analysing search terms is to
examine how advertising algorithms classify
internet users

An alternative to analysing search terms is to examine
how advertising algorithms classify internet users
(Zagheni et al., 2017). Facebook’s Advertising Manager
was developed to improve the accuracy of audience
targeting. It can display an estimate of the number of
individuals meeting certain criteria explicitly reported by
Facebook users (such as being between 18 and 24 years
old and being an upper secondary school graduate)
in combination with classifications inferred by Facebook
from their activities and interactions on the internet,
such as having an interest in a certain topic (for example,
international scholarships).
A study validating Facebook’s data against selfreporting results in an online survey with respondents
recruited through targeted Facebook advertisements
indicated good overall accuracy of demographic
classification (Grow et al., 2022). However, the age group
18-24 was misclassified relatively often, perhaps because
respondents had made themselves older at the time of
initially joining the platform. With respect to inferred
interest, the underlying algorithm is proprietary and not
transparent. The resulting estimates, therefore, cannot be
taken at face value. However, the fact that uncertainty is
recognized, and a range provided, increases credibility.
With these caveats in mind, Facebook’s estimates of
18- to 24-year-olds with upper secondary school
certificates and an interest in international scholarships
are charted in various countries alongside the number
enrolled in tertiary education or studying abroad. Under
the assumption that the estimates are of the right
order of magnitude, two conclusions can be drawn.
On the one hand, only a small fraction of all students,
and even fewer upper secondary school graduates,
in low- and middle-income countries display an interest
in international scholarships in their online behaviour.
On the other hand, despite being a relatively small group,
the number of those who are interested by far exceeds
the availability of scholarships. The 2020 GEM Report
estimated that the top 50 scholarship providers offered
only around 30,000 new scholarships in 2019; yet,
in Uganda alone, almost 100,000 youth were considered to
be among those ‘interested’ in a scholarship (Figure 20.7).

To respect both privacy and sample size concerns,
neither Google nor Facebook publish estimates that
are too small. On Google Trends, the search index for a
given keyword and matching country is not published if
the number of searches falls below a certain threshold.
Facebook Advertising data do not provide estimates for
audiences smaller than 1,000, precluding its use for
looking for scholarship holders from specific countries
(Fatehkia et al., 2022).

20

Most problematically, data on online behaviour are almost
entirely proprietary. Some data are made available to
the public, some through ad hoc requests and some are
commercially available for marketing purposes. In any
case, data availability is at the discretion of the companies
owning the data. The data themselves are, at best,
calibrated internally, but there is no outside validation,
at least none that is publicly available. It can only be
assumed, without knowing for certain, that an increase in
online searches for the term ‘scholarships UK’ indicates
an increase in actual interest. Even less is known about
increases in scholarship applications. Academic research
suggests that the intention to migrate internationally
does affect migration overall, albeit in a complex interplay
with diverse factors such as opportunities, social capital,
skills and information that vary between individuals
(Wanner, 2021). This experimental analysis does not try
to predict actual scholarship mobility. Non-traditional
data sources show some promise where official data
are not forthcoming. However, many obstacles prevent
satisfactory estimates from Google Trends (Leysen and
Verhaeghe, 2022). The analysis presented here only
scratches the surface, and the limitations must be noted,
such as results relying upon the selection of an exact
search term.

Progress on increasing the proportion of qualified teachers was uneven across regions and education levels
between 2015 and 2020. The greatest improvement took place in sub-Saharan Africa, where the share of qualified
teachers increased from 53% to 60% in pre-primary education and from 59% to 65% in upper secondary education.
Nevertheless, the region is still far from achieving its 2030 benchmarks.
Teachers are often qualified but not trained or trained but not qualified. In Lebanon, 77% of primary school teachers
have the minimum required academic qualifications but only 23% have the minimum pedagogical training.
Efforts to increase the supply of qualified teachers must consider teacher attrition, which varies widely across
countries and education levels. In Ethiopia, primary school teacher attrition rates fell from 5% in 2015 to below the
2020 target of 2%.
In high-income countries, teachers tend to be paid less than similarly educated workers in other sectors. Primary
teacher salaries in Czechia increased by over 50% between 2010 and 2020, but teachers still earned 26% less than
other tertiary-educated workers.
Many countries face a shortage of science and mathematics teachers because few enter the profession and
even fewer stay. In the United States, there were over 30,000 vacancies for physics teachers in 2019. Policies to
encourage recruitment, training and retention of teachers in these subjects include bonuses upon signing, salary
supplements and the targeting of graduates or professionals who currently have a non-teaching career.

minimum required academic qualifications, but only
23% have the minimum pedagogical training. Interpreting
these statistics is impossible without knowing the
minimum required academic and training qualifications
in each country. In Uruguay, a teacher must complete a
bachelor’s degree to teach in a primary school, while in
India, an upper secondary certificate suffices. Comparisons
across training requirements are arguably even harder,
as there is no common international classification for
training programmes. What is even more confusing is
that in some countries, qualifications and training are
considered one and the same, leading many to report the
same number for both indicators.

UNESCO is taking steps to improve data collection on
teachers. In 2019, the UNESCO General Conference
endorsed the development of an International Standard
Classification of Teacher Training Programmes (ISCED-T)
to support the monitoring of SDG target 4.c. ISCED-T is
a framework for assembling, compiling and analysing
cross-nationally comparable statistics on teacher training
programmes (UNESCO, 2021). The UNESCO Institute for
Statistics (UIS) has also started collecting information

Progress since 2015: SDG indicator 4.c.1
Progress on increasing the proportion of teachers with the minimum required qualifications – or, more specifically, who have received
at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service and in-service – has been uneven and limited across regions
and education levels (Figure 21.2). To the extent that comparisons can be made with the available data, the greatest increases since
2015 have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, although the region still lags behind all others at all levels of education. At the pre-primary
level, which had the lowest starting point, the share increased from 53% in 2015 to 60% in 2020. In upper secondary education, the share
increased from 59% to 65%. Countries in the region are also far from achieving their national 2030 benchmarks of 84% for pre-primary,
92% for primary and lower secondary, and 89% for upper secondary education.

Attrition must be discussed in the context of efforts
to increase the supply of qualified teachers. In the
United States, for instance, attrition accounts for about
90% of the annual demand for teachers (Carver-Thomas
and Darling-Hammond, 2017). Attrition is also linked to
teacher shortages, which is a growing problem not only in
Northern America (Garcia and Weiss, 2019) but also
in Europe (Albert et al., 2022) and other high-income
countries (Welch, 2022). While some level of voluntary
and involuntary attrition is to be expected, excessive
attrition wastes resources and can severely disrupt
education systems.
Indicator 4.c.6 estimates attrition rates by considering
current-year data on total teachers and new teachers
and previous-year data on total teachers. Although data
are patchy, results highlight that attrition rates vary
widely across countries and education levels (Figure 21.3).
For instance, teacher attrition in lower secondary
education is around 15% in both Rwanda and Sierra Leone,
but is 21% in Sierra Leone and 3% in Rwanda in
primary education.
Measuring attrition is difficult, and there are limitations
to interpreting the data of indicator 4.c.6. First, it does not
distinguish between permanent leavers and temporary
ones, for example on maternity or sick leave. Second,
it considers each level of education separately, so it cannot
be used to estimate system-level attrition. In Lithuania,

for instance, teacher attrition from the education
system (from pre-primary to upper secondary education
combined) was 4% in 2016 but ranged from 0.8% in primary
to nearly 8% in upper secondary (OECD, 2021a). Teachers
who move between levels count as ‘leavers’ in one level
and ‘new entrants’ in another. Movement across levels
is common in some countries, especially when multiple
levels are integrated in a single structure, as is the case for
primary and lower secondary education in Finland (OECD,
2021a). Third, it uses headcounts – the total number
of teachers – as opposed to full-time equivalents, so it
counts both full- and part-time teachers equally and does
not capture changes in work intensity. In Norway, teacher
attrition in primary education in 2016 was 12% using
headcounts, but 8% using full-time equivalents, suggesting
that many leavers worked part-time (OECD, 2021a).

It is important to distinguish involuntary
attrition – retirement and sickness – from
voluntary attrition, which may signal bad
working conditions or other disincentives
Policies to address attrition rates must also consider
the reasons for attrition. At a minimum, it is important
to distinguish involuntary attrition – retirement and
sickness – from voluntary attrition, which may signal

bad working conditions or other disincentives. Data from
an OECD survey of 13 upper-middle and high-income
countries show that teacher attrition drops by an average
of 2 percentage points when excluding retiring teachers
(OECD, 2021a). Finally, analysing national attrition levels
may mask significant distribution challenges within

countries (Box 21.2). And even if a system has low attrition
rates overall, there may be major shortages of teachers
in specific areas, such as science and mathematics
(Focus 21.1).

B OX 21.2 :

Ethiopia has set ambitious goals for teacher attrition
Over the past decade, Ethiopia has set two ambitious goals for
reducing teacher attrition rates. In its 2016–20 Education Sector
Development Plan (ESDP V), Ethiopia set a target to reduce attrition
to 2% by 2020, which was then further lowered to 1% by 2025 in
the following plan (EDSP VI) (Ethiopia Ministry of Education, 2015a;
2021a). The achievement of these targets is monitored annually
through the education management information system, which
disaggregates data by region, gender, education level and reason
for leaving. Between 2015 and 2022, attrition rates decreased
considerably for both primary and secondary education, though
only primary education met the 2020 target of 2%. Both levels are
on track to reach the 2025 target (Figure 21.4).

Designing policies to reduce attrition requires understanding the
reasons why teachers are leaving. In 2022, 37% of primary teachers
who left did so for what can be classified as avoidable reasons from
a public policy perspective, namely ‘leaving the teaching profession’,
‘political post’ or ‘ethical problem’. Attrition for involuntary reasons
– retirement, death or prolonged sickness – comprised 32% of
attrition (Figure 21.5). The proportions are very similar at the
secondary level.

But rates vary considerably within the country in primary
education, from nearly 4% in Harari to less than 0.5% in Amhara.
Rates also vary by gender, particularly at the secondary level. In
2022, the attrition rate of female teachers (2.4%) was more than
twice that of male teachers (1.1%). This is of concern given that
female teachers are already a minority at this level of education,
representing only 20% of the teaching force (Ethiopia Ministry of
Education, 2022).

Various factors influence teachers’ decisions to enter and
stay in the profession. Indicator 4.c.5 aims to capture one
of these factors by measuring the ‘average teacher salary
relative to other professions requiring a comparable level
of qualifications’ – a proxy for the attractiveness of the
teaching profession.

In high-income countries, teachers tend to be
paid less than similarly educated workers in
other sectors
In high-income countries, teachers tend to be paid
less than similarly educated workers in other sectors.
In Sweden, for example, primary education teachers
earned 20% less than tertiary-educated workers in 2020.
This share has remained relatively stable over the past
decade, even though teachers’ salaries have increased
by over 20% in the same period (Figure 21.6). In Czechia,
primary teacher salaries increased by over 50% between

2010 and 2020, somewhat closing the gap with the
salaries of other tertiary-educated workers, from 53% in
2010 to 74% in 2020. Czechia’s Department of Education,
Health Care, Culture and Social Security Statistics
highlights that increases in teacher salaries have become
more dynamic since 2019 and that pay gaps differ by age –
older teachers received greater increases in salaries – and
by region – in Prague, teachers earn 93% of the gross
average wage in the city (Ribas, 2020).
In low- and middle-income countries, the reported values
for this indicator show that teachers are more likely
to earn higher salaries than other professionals. Yet,
measurement challenges – including weakly developed
formal labour markets and uncaptured income – may
obscure comparisons (UNESCO, 2021). Other demographic
and social factors may also influence the interpretation
of this indicator. A study of 15 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa found that teachers earned more than other workers
in 10 countries, but after controlling for education, age,
gender and location, teachers had a premium in only
5 countries and had lower salaries in 7 (Evans et al., 2022).

A more recent review of teacher salaries in sub-Saharan
Africa highlights the shortcomings of arguments and data
that point to teachers being relatively well paid in the
region. Concerns include the non-differentiation of teacher
salaries by contract type or type of institution, low sample
sizes and the workers considered ‘comparable wage
workers’ (Bennell, 2023).

F I G U R E 21. 7:

A lack of sufficient or competent STEM teachers affects
instruction in many schools

their school is affected ‘some’ or ‘a lot’ by a shortage or
inadequacy of STEM staff, selected countries, 2019

Another problem is that even fewer teachers stay in the
subjects. Turnover rates in STEM are consistently the
highest, including compared to other shortage subjects
such as special education or English as a second language
(Malkus et al., 2015). In rural areas, STEM teachers rarely
stay in a teaching position for more than five years
(Aragon, 2016; Goodpaster et al., 2012).
One internationally comparable source of school-level data
on STEM teacher shortages is the principals’ questionnaire
of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science
Study (TIMSS). In some middle-income countries, such as
Malaysia or Türkiye, more than 80% of secondary schools
face a shortage of adequate mathematics and science
teachers. On average, close to 30% of schools across
participating countries face such a shortage (Figure 21.7).
This shortage is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa.
Only around 30% of the region’s short-cycle tertiary
enrolment is in STEM subjects (25% of female and 34% of
male enrolments) (Phiri, 2021). According to an estimate
produced for this report,1 sub-Saharan Africa is the only
region where its small number of STEM graduates is
insufficient to provide an adequate number of STEM
teachers to meet SDG 4 needs by 2030, even if every single
STEM graduate could be recruited into teaching.
STEM graduates often enjoy many alternatives to teaching
(Worth et al., 2022; Han and Hur, 2022). The shortfall

Among teaching specialities, the science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects face
some of the greatest staffing shortfalls. One reason is
that not enough people enter the profession. In England,
United Kingdom, entry into initial teacher training is
only 17% of the target number for physics and 30% for
computing (Department for Education, 2023). In the
United States, there were over 30,000 vacancies for
physics teachers in 2019 but only some 6,000 physics
majors (Foresman, 2019).

by 2030 of people who can work in computing and
mathematics is estimated to be as high as 6 million
workers in the United States and around 1 million in
Germany1 (Strack et al., 2021). The average pay gap for
mathematics and science graduates between teaching
and non-teaching careers is higher than for other subjects
(Britton et al., 2016; LiVecchi, 2017; Migration Advisory
Committee, 2016; Benhenda and Sims, 2022), and STEM
students may further overestimate this gap and the
financial disadvantage of becoming teachers
(Marder et al., 2018).
Various policies have been implemented to encourage
the recruitment, training and retention of STEM teachers.
Recruitment incentives sometimes include significant
bonuses for signing on teachers in shortage subjects.
In England, United Kingdom, a target 8% gross salary
supplement for early-career mathematics and physics
teachers made them 23% less likely to leave their teaching
post in public education (Benhenda and Sims, 2022),
mirroring similar results in the United States. Retaining an
additional teacher via the incentive resulted in a 32% lower

1 Annual STEM graduates were estimated as the average between the share of STEM graduates multiplied by overall tertiary enrolment, assuming 10% of enrolled
students graduate in a given year, and the share of STEM graduates multiplied by the gross graduation ratio from tertiary education applied to one fifth of the
tertiary-age population. The annual recruitment need is taken from UIS 2016 estimates, dividing the annual recruitment need for 2015–30 uniformly across years.

cost than training a replacement. Another approach is to
target graduates or professionals who currently have a
non-teaching career. In the German states of Berlin and
Saxony, those having gone through alternative certification
schemes already make up half of all newly recruited
teachers (Tillmann, 2019), and the same is true of STEM
teachers in the US state of Texas (Fuller and Pendola,
2019).
The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences,
a non-governmental network of centres of excellence
in post-graduate training in Cameroon, Ghana, Rwanda,
Senegal and South Africa, established the five-year
STEM-focused Teacher Training Program to provide
not only professional development but also classroom
resources. Both the centres in Ghana and South Africa
use blended combinations of in-person and online
training to improve teachers’ subject knowledge and
teaching skills, especially those serving disadvantaged
populations (AAMN, 2022). In Cameroon, the training
model includes building the capacity of ‘master trainers’
at teacher training institutions and raising awareness
among principals regarding the importance of providing
support to mathematics teachers (AIMS Cameroon, 2023).
In Rwanda, VVOB, a non-governmental organization,
similarly focuses on training STEM mentors and subject
leaders and establishing communities of practice among
them (Kuppens, 2019).

317

C H A P T E R 2 1 • T eachers

Enabling teachers already in the system to teach STEM
subjects can be an effective way to increase coverage.
One option is to train interdisciplinary STEM teachers
already at the initial teacher training stage (Zonnefeld and
Zonnefeld, 2019). However, qualifying teachers across
subjects can be challenging. In 2018 in Thailand, under
the Teacher Development Coupon scheme for in-service
teacher training for 270,000 teachers, only 0.5% of the
coupons were for STEM-related courses (Yamkasikorn,
2021).

Where there is scarcity, there is inequity

Where there is scarcity, there is inequity. The shortage of
STEM teachers brings heightened challenges of diversity
and equitable provision (Foresman, 2019). In the US state
of California, three quarters of secondary STEM students
are non-white, but only one quarter of secondary STEM
classes are taught by a non-white teacher
(Ridley-Kerr et al., 2020). And STEM teachers are not
distributed equally across schools. STEM teachers are
missing from schools that are already disadvantaged,
further aggravating inequality. In the United States,
asymmetric teacher mobility between schools results in
a significant share of mathematics and science teachers
shifting from poor to better-off schools, from schools with
more minority students to schools with fewer, and from
urban to suburban schools (Ingersoll and May, 2012).

KE Y MESSAGES
Global education funding increased slightly from 3.9% of GDP in 2005 to 4.2% in 2021. Government spending on
education amounted to 14.1% of total public expenditure in 2021. Among the 178 countries with available data
for 2017–22, 34% did not meet either of the established benchmarks of at least 4% of GDP and 15% of total public
expenditure.
Between 2000 and 2020, general government revenue increased from 24% to 26% of GDP. In Ecuador and Tajikistan,
it rose by 12 percentage points of GDP and the share of education in total public expenditure grew by 6 percentage
points. In Argentina and Azerbaijan, general government revenue also increased by 12 percentage points of GDP, but
the share of education in total public expenditure fell by 4 percentage points in Argentina and 11 percentage points
in Azerbaijan.
The proportion of lower-income countries either in or at high risk of debt distress rose from 21% in 2013 to 58% in
March 2022. Debt repayment as a share of gross national income reached 7% in Rwanda, 8% in Zambia and 9% in
Sudan, even before the outbreak of civil conflict.
At the peak of the previous debt crisis in 1994, the median country had a public debt/GDP ratio of 72%, compared
with 33% at the end of 2021. Still, if recent trends continue, 1990s levels could be reached within seven years. The
two crises differ in debt composition, with the share of domestic debt being higher; in addition, the creditor countries
have changed.
Aid to education decreased by 7% from USD 19.3 billion in 2020 to USD 17.8 billion in 2021; it fell by 20% in subSaharan Africa. The share of aid allocated to education reached its lowest point since 2015, with only 9.8% dedicated
to the sector in 2021.
The annual financing gap for low- and lower-middle-income countries to achieve their national SDG 4 benchmarks by
2030 is estimated at USD 97 billion. This represents 2.2% of GDP and 24% of the total cost, on average.
Three scenarios of increasing ambition have been developed to capture the cost of digital transformation in
education. If low-income countries implemented a basic offline scenario while lower-middle-income countries
worked towards a scenario of fully connected schools, these countries would need to spend USD 21 billion per
year between 2024 and 2030 for capital expenditure and USD 12 billion per year for operational expenditure. The
combined cost would increase their financing gap by 50%.
School feeding programmes, which are crucial social protection interventions in low- and middle-income countries,
can increase household income by up to 15% in low-income areas.

lobal expenditure on education, from public, donor and
household sources, increased slightly to USD 5.4 trillion
in 2021, driven by increases in government spending
in low- and middle-income countries. Governments
accounted for 78% of global education spending in
2021 (UNESCO and World Bank, 2023).
This chapter reviews the latest financial statistics on
public and aid expenditure and also explores three policy
issues in more depth. First, it describes the growing debt
crisis and how it affects poorer countries’ ability to spend
on education. Second, it estimates what it would cost
countries to achieve national education targets by 2030 as
well as the cost of digital transformation, analysing
three scenarios. Third, in the context of rising prices and
increasing difficulties for the poorest families, it describes
the contexts in which school feeding programmes can help.

Globally, median public education expenditure increased
slightly from 3.9% of GDP in 2005 to 4.3% of GDP in
2021, ranging from 3.3% in Eastern and South-eastern
Asia to 5.4% in Oceania. Globally, the median share of
education in total public spending was 14.2% in 2021,
ranging from 9.6% in Northern Africa and Western Asia to
16.5% in sub-Saharan Africa. High-income countries spend
1.3 percentage points of GDP more but 4.4 percentage
points of total government expenditure less than
low-income countries.
Among the 178 countries with available data in 2017–22,
61 – or 34% – did not meet either of the established
benchmarks (Figure 22.1). These countries span income
levels and regions, and include Cameroon, China, Ireland,

The Education 2030 Framework for Action sets two public
education spending benchmarks. Ambiguously, it urged
countries to spend 4% to 6% of their gross domestic
product (GDP) on education ‘and/or’ 15% to 20% of their
total public expenditure. Considering that poorer countries
tend to have small budgets but a high demographic
pressure to prioritize education while richer countries have
large budgets but a relatively small school-age population,
the GEM Report has long argued that meeting either of
the two benchmarks should be considered a minimum
requirement. For instance, France spent 5.4% of GDP on
education in 2018, one of the highest ratios in the world,
which, however, corresponds to just 9.7% of total public
expenditure. In contrast, Indonesia had one of the highest
education shares in total public expenditure in 2020 –
19.1% – but one of the lowest as a share of GDP – 2.8%.

Since 2000, countries have increased their general
government revenues from taxes and social contributions
as a share of GDP from 24% to 26%. Middle-income
countries increased their revenues from 21% in 2000 to
25% in 2020. In some countries, higher revenue has
been accompanied by higher prioritization of education.
For instance, in Ecuador and Tajikistan, general
government revenue increased by 12 percentage points
of GDP and the share of education in total government
expenditure increased by 6 percentage points between
2000 and 2020. By contrast, Argentina and Azerbaijan
also increased their general government revenue by
12 percentage points of GDP in this period, but the share
of education in total government expenditure fell by 4 and
11 percentage points, respectively. The share of education
remained constant in Cambodia (at just under 12%) and in
the Islamic Republic of Iran (at 22%) over the 20 years, even
though general revenue increased by 14 percentage points
of GDP in the former and decreased by 11 percentage
points in the latter (Figure 22.2).
SOME FEAR A RETURN TO THE DEBT
CRISIS OF THE 1980S
The debt crisis facing poor countries, specifically the
69 lower-income countries within the Debt Sustainability
Framework, has intensified in recent years. While they
had emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis
that hit the Global North in 2008–09, they have been
affected adversely by increasing expenditure and falling
revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic and by the food,
fertilizer and energy price hikes triggered by the war
in Ukraine. The median public gross financing need is a
measure used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to describe pressure on government finances brought
about by debt service payments and other requirements
to cover fiscal deficits. In just three years, up to the end
of 2022, the median public gross financing need in the
69 lower-income countries showed an increase from
5.5% to 9.3% of GDP. This pressure, combined with a
negative outlook in global financial markets, has worsened
the terms with which these countries can borrow
(Chuku et al., 2023).
By the end of March 2022, the proportion of lower-income
countries either in or at high risk of debt distress had risen
to 58%, compared to just 21% in 2013 (IMF, 2022). By the

By the end of March 2022, the proportion of
lower-income countries either in or at high risk
of debt distress rose to 58%, compared to just
21% in 2013
end of May 2023, the number of those in distress had
risen from 9 to 11, or 16% of all countries (IMF, 2023b).
Debt burden varies widely among these countries. Debt
repayment as a share of gross national income (GNI)
had reached 7% in Rwanda, 8% in Zambia and 9% in
Sudan even before the outbreak of the civil conflict (IMF,
2022). It is unclear how high these repayments are in
Mozambique, where a ‘hidden debts’ scandal involving
the now discredited and bankrupt Credit Suisse has been
looming since 2016 (Gebregziabher and Sala, 2022; Jones,
2022). In 2020, external debt servicing payments had
already exceeded education spending in 21 out of 69 Debt
Sustainability Framework countries (Munnelly, 2022). Prior
to its agreement with the IMF, Ghana spent almost twice
as much on debt servicing as it did on education in 2019.

Poor countries experienced a major debt crisis in
the 1980s. At the time, debt to official creditors was
rescheduled but this protracted response did not prevent
arrears from accumulating (Chuku et al., 2023). The IMF
and the World Bank meanwhile implemented structural
adjustment packages, which included measures such as
reducing public service employment, eliminating food
subsidies and cutting social expenditure (Buchmann, 1996).
Although data quality does not allow precise analyses of
that period, two studies indicate how spiralling debt and
structural adjustment influenced education expenditure.
First, an analysis of seven, mostly lower-middle-income
countries has shown that for every 1% increase in the
external debt-to-exports ratio, a key measure of the debt
servicing burden, there was a corresponding reduction
of 0.33% in public education expenditure (Khundadze and
Alvarez, 2022). Second, public spending on education was
shown to be highly volatile in the 1990s, and more volatile
than health spending (Lewis and Verhoeven, 2010).
The consequences of debt and structural adjustment
policies for education and overall social development were
far-reaching, devastating and long-term. In sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, the gross intake rate to the last grade
of primary school peaked at 59% in 1984 and did not reach

website (completion rates).

the same level for another 20 years. Even today, one in
four children in the region do not complete primary school
(Figure 22.4). Debt also had equity implications. Female
secondary school enrolment dropped during the period
while male enrolment remained constant
(Buchmann, 1996).
During the early 1990s, the toll of structural adjustment
programmes was recognized and the programmes started
protecting essential social services, such as education.
But it was not until the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative, launched by the IMF and World Bank
in 1996 after strong lobbying from non-governmental
organizations, that more decisive action was taken.
In 2005, it was extended through the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative. These actions helped eligible countries
receive complete debt relief from the IMF, the World Bank,
the African Development Fund and the Inter-American
Development Bank, whose volume was estimated to reach
USD 59 billion by 2005 (Chauvin and Kraay, 2007).
To qualify for the HIPC, countries had to develop poverty
reduction strategy papers, introduce social sector policy
reforms and increase social expenditure. Views on the
impact of the HIPC vary. An increase in debt relief did

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

324

22

not increase health and education spending as a share
of total public expenditure (Chauvin and Kraay, 2005;
2007). Another analysis qualified the conclusion, arguing
that education expenditure increased in those African
countries that improved their institutions (Dessy and
Vencatachellum, 2007). However, these analyses may have
been premature: a long-term, more recent review confirms
that debt relief did help indebted countries get their
education development trajectory back on track
(Ferry et al., 2022).
The current crisis is not yet as severe. At the peak of the
previous crisis in 1994, the median country had a public
debt-to-GDP ratio of 72%, while the same ratio was
33% at the end of 2021. The public and publicly guaranteed
external debt-to-export ratio was 318% in 1994 but
137% in 2021; in 1994, 38 of the 69 countries had breached
the 150% limit for this indicator, compared to 25 countries
in 2021. Still, if recent trends are to continue, the levels of
the 1990s could be reached within seven years
(Chuku et al., 2023).
However, the two crises differ significantly in the
composition of the debt. First, the share of domestic debt
in total debt, which was less than 20% in the mid-1990s,
had grown to 35% by 2021: while this reduces the risk to
exchange rate depreciation, it exposes countries even
more to systemic crisis. Second, external debt is more
diversified, which affects the scope of potential solutions.
The previous crisis mainly involved borrowing from official
creditors (known as the Paris Club and accounting for
39% of total debt in the mid-1990s), which was mainly in
concessional terms (Chuku et al., 2023). Between 2006 and
2020, the share of Paris Club creditors in total debt fell
further from 28% to 10%, while the share of China and
other non-Paris creditors increased from 8% to 22%
and that of commercial creditors from 10% to 19%
(Chabert et al., 2022). The borrowing agreements with
creditors other than multilateral agencies and the Paris
Club sometimes lacks explicit information on the exposure
of indebted countries to risks (Chuku et al., 2023; Rieffel,
2021).
Triggered by the COVID-19 emergency in 2020, the Debt
Service Suspension Initiative enabled 73 eligible countries
to not make any interest payments or repayments,
relieving costs of USD 12.9 billion between May 2020 and
December 2021 (Siaba Serrate, 2023). By the end of
2020, the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment
was established to provide substantive relief, albeit on a
country-by-country basis (Chuku et al., 2023). The shift of
this dialogue under the auspices of the G20 reflects the
changes in debt composition (Brautigam and Huang, 2023).
But while the intention to move from rescheduling debt

325

C H A P T E R 2 2 • F inance

to more radical solutions was declared faster than
in the 1990s, implementation has not followed suit
(Chuku et al., 2023). Only Chad has succeeded among
the handful of countries that requested debt treatment
(Chabert et al., 2022). Across countries, the share of
debt relief in official development assistance, which rose
from 6% in 1995 to 21% in 2005 at the peak of the HIPC
programme implementation, has since been negligible
(Figure 22.5).
Yet more action is needed. The gap between social
spending and debt service payments in lower-income
countries was just over one percentage point in 1996,
increased to eight percentage points by 2011 but by
2020 had gradually fallen to less than six percentage
points in HIPC countries (Chuku et al., 2023). In two
countries that have been particularly affected by the
unfolding debt crisis, interest payments have increased
considerably: from a negligible 0.3% of GNI in 2011, they
increased to 1.7% in Ghana in 2021 and to 3.5% in Zambia
in 2019, before falling by two thirds in 2021. Education
spending, which had reached very high levels in Ghana
around 2010, fell from 4.6% of GDP in 2013 to 3.9% in 2018.
In Zambia, education spending levels increased after the
HIPC programme implementation from a very low 1.1% of
GDP in 2008 to 3.7% in 2012, and fluctuated at around
4% of GDP in the 2010s (Figure 22.6).
Ghana defaulted on its external debt in December
2022 and has applied for debt restructuring under the
G20 Common Framework (Acheampong, 2023). However,
53% of Ghana’s external debt is in the hands of private
creditors, which makes restructuring complicated.
Nevertheless, after its bilateral creditors, of which China
was the largest, agreed to a debt restructuring, Ghana
reached a USD 3 billion agreement with the IMF. Under the
terms of the agreement, the government has committed
to increase school capitation grants, strengthen teacher
in-service training, invest in primary teaching and learning
materials for schools, and continue building its student
assessment system. In response to IMF criticism that the
commitment to free secondary education is inequitable,
the government has also undertaken to ‘incentivize’ the
poorest to enrol in upper secondary education
(IMF, 2023a).
Zambia defaulted in November 2020, the first African
country to do so in this debt crisis. It also applied for
debt restructuring under the G20 Common Framework.
Protracted negotiations, which were described as a
‘test case’ for the G20 Common Framework, reached a
successful conclusion to restructure USD 6.3 billion of its
external debt in the run-up to the Summit on a New Global
Financing Pact in June 2023 (Reuters, 2023; Short, 2023).

AID EXPENDITURE
While domestic financing is by far the most important
component of education financing, external financing
can still play an important role in the countries which
are most in need, as long as it follows the principles of
aid effectiveness. In other words, it is not enough to
judge aid solely by its volume: it should also be evaluated
according to whether donors respect ownership,
alignment, harmonization, results orientation and mutual
accountability in their partnerships with beneficiaries
(UNESCO, 2021).

It is not enough to judge aid solely by its
volume
Nevertheless, volume remains the main aid characteristic
under scrutiny. In 2022, according to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) database,
official donors provided USD 233 billion in official
development assistance (ODA), an increase of
USD 30 billion (or 14%) over 2021, the largest year-on-year
increase since 2016. The increase was largely due to
donor countries’ expenditure to accommodate Ukrainian
refugees. As a result, DAC donor aid levels reached 0.36%,
a level not seen since 1982, even if well below the 0.7% DAC
target. Germany exceeded this target for the first time and
reached 0.83% in 2022; by contrast, the United Kingdom,
which met this target between 2013 and 2020, dropped to
0.51% in 2022.
Scandinavian countries, the world’s most generous donors,
have also gradually reduced their aid levels, more gradually
in the case of Denmark (from 0.86% in 2014 to 0.70% in
2022) and more abruptly in 2020–22 in the case of Norway
(from 1.11% to 0.86%) and Sweden (from 1.14% to 0.90%).
In response to growing refugee numbers, Nordic countries
have also redirected some of their ODA to support
refugees in their own countries (Hill, 2022).
Norway initially planned to reallocate NOK 4 billion
(USD 410 million) from its contributions to United Nations
(UN) agencies to accommodate refugees, but later
reconsidered due to recalculated costs (Chadwick, 2022b).
Norway has proposed to reduce its ODA from 1.15% of

327

C H A P T E R 2 2 • F inance

GNI to 0.75% in 2023 (IIRR, 2023). Sweden redistributed
17% of its ODA to refugee admissions in 2023 and has
set a fixed amount for ODA for the next few years, which
means its share would drop further to 0.88% of GNI by
2023 (Chadwick, 2022a, 2022d, 2022c; The Local, 2022).
The overall increase in ODA has not translated into
more aid to education. According to the OECD Creditor
Reporting System (CRS), aid to education fell from USD
19.3 billion in 2020 to USD 17.8 billion in 2021 – a 7% drop
(Figure 22.7). The main reason behind this decline was
the reduction in general budget support, which returned
to pre-COVID-19 levels. Excluding budget support, direct
aid to education has remained stagnant since 2018 at
USD 15.1 billion annually. Basic education accounts for
39% of total aid, secondary education for 21% and tertiary
education for 40%. Since 2010, the share of basic education
has fallen by five percentage points while the share of
secondary education has increased by four percentage
points. In terms of primary school-age children, the CRS
database assigns almost 85% of aid to education to
individual recipient countries. Of that amount, low-income
countries have received 22% of aid to education and 28% of
aid to basic education since 2010. But since 2015, there
has been a notable increase in aid to basic education
targeted at low-income countries. In absolute terms,
the amount they received almost doubled from USD

1.1 billion in 2015 to USD 2.0 billion in 2020, before falling
to USD 1.7 billion in 2021. In relative terms, the share
increased from 23% in 2015 to 32% in 2020 before falling to
29% in 2021.
Sub-Saharan Africa, which has over half of the world’s
out-of-school children, is also the largest recipient of
aid for basic education, accounting for USD 2.1 billion,
or 31% of the total in 2021, remaining roughly at the same
level as it was in 2010 (USD 1.9 billion, or 20% of the
total). By contrast, the amount of aid to basic education
disbursed in Middle East and North Africa increased from
USD 0.8 billion in 2010 to USD 1.9 billion in 2021, or from
12% to 28% of the total, largely as a result of the response
to the Syrian refugee crisis.
In 2021, more than 50% of the total aid to education
came from the European Union, France, Germany,
Saudi Arabia and the World Bank. Nearly 70% was from
these five donors plus Japan, the United Kingdom and
the United States. In the three-year period from 2019 to
2021, Germany was the largest donor, allocating an
average of USD 3.3 billion per year. But Germany, as well
as France, allocates nearly 60% of its aid to education at
the post-secondary level, largely through scholarships
and imputed student fees, which are waived tuition
expenses whose economic value is estimated and recorded
as aid. Japan allocates more than one third of its aid to

scholarships and imputed student fees. The United States,
by contrast, does not provide aid in the form
of scholarships.
Excluding scholarships and imputed student fees,
the World Bank is the largest donor (USD 1.8 billion per
year), followed by Germany and the United States
(USD 1.4 billion each), and the European Union
(USD 1 billion). However, the level of aid from the United
States has plateaued in the last few years while that of the
United Kingdom dropped by 39% between 2014–16 and
2019–21, as a result of the policy decision to no longer
allocate 0.7% of GNI to ODA (Figure 22.8).
The share of education in total sector allocable aid fell
throughout the 2000s and reached a low point of 9.7% in
2013. Although there were some subsequent signs that the
share might be recovering – reaching 10.9% in 2019 – it fell
back to 9.7% in 2020–21, absorbing part of the impact from
the shift in donor focus towards health, which increased
from 16.5% in 2019 to 19.5% in 2020 and 23.3% in 2021.
While analyses of aid traditionally focus on disbursements,
the OECD CRS database also offers information on
commitments. However, comparing the two is not
straightforward: commitments predate disbursements by
some years. While the two measures tend to be broadly
consistent with each other, in recent years, there has

been a larger discrepancy between commitments and
disbursements towards education among multilateral
donors. In 2020, this could have been the result of prior
commitments that could not be absorbed by recipient
countries during COVID-19, but the discrepancy was first
observed in 2017–18 (Figure 22.9). Even before such
an increase in discrepancy, the Global Partnership for
Effective Development Cooperation called for analysis of
the drivers of this gap (GPEDC, 2016).
A particular case of disbursement lags is the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE). Since its establishment in
2003, GPE had approved USD 7.8 billion in implementation
grants, of which it had disbursed USD 6 billion by the end
of 2022. The average time lag between a GPE project’s
approval and its implementation was five months
(GPE, 2021a). But the lag between grant approvals and
grant disbursements is some three years on average.
After peaking at over USD 1 billion in 2013, grant
approvals fell by more than 90% by 2017 before picking
up speed, reaching USD 400 million in 2018-19 and

Comparing disbursements and commitments
is not straightforward as commitments
predate disbursements by some years
then returning to historic heights of over USD 1 billion
during the COVID-19 crisis. GPE is currently conducting
an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of this
considerable increase in the middle of the pandemic. Grant
disbursements exceeded USD 500 billion for the first time
in 2021–22 (Figure 22.10). The amount represents about
10% of aid to basic education for low- and middle-income
countries, similar to levels previously achieved in 2013–15.
Grants dominate ODA to education. In 2021, they
accounted for 71% of the total, compared to 63% in health,
47% in agriculture, 20% in energy and 8% in transport.
Within the education sector, grants made up as much
as 84% of the total in low-income countries, compared

Countries that are no longer eligible for concessional loans
are less inclined to seek non-concessional loans for their
social sectors, especially education (Gatti and Mohpal,
2019). The International Finance Facility for Education,
which was launched at the Transforming Education Summit
in September 2022, aims to make non-concessional
lending more appealing to lower-middle-income countries
by lowering their borrowing cost, and to development
banks by providing them with donor guarantees, which will
give them access to additional capital market funds (IFFEd,
2023). However, at a time when countries are under debt
distress, loans, even ones with more attractive conditions,
may put further pressure on countries’ finances.

CAN COUNTRIES AFFORD THEIR NATIONAL SDG 4
BENCHMARKS?
The international community has committed to ambitious
education targets to be achieved by 2030, notably
universal secondary completion. The challenge was
always going to be a major one, but slow progress since
2015 and the unexpected onset of COVID-19 mean
that it is no longer useful to estimate the cost to
low- and lower-middle-income countries of achieving
the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) targets,
as this report has done twice before, in 2015 and 2020.
No matter how much money is spent, the targets are no
longer achievable. Arguably, these targets were always
aspirational instead of achievable. However, a notable
development in the past two years has been that countries
have set national benchmarks for selected SDG 4 indicators
to be achieved by 2025 and 2030 (Chapter 11). This step
invites a reformulation of the challenge: what will it take
countries to achieve the 2030 targets they have set
for themselves? An updated model accounts for each
country's progress and unique challenges yet assumes
that countries will meet their national education targets by
2030 for basic and secondary education, using indicators
such as the percentage of out-of-school pupils for primary
and secondary education and participation rates in
pre-primary education.

No matter how much money is spent, the
targets are no longer achievable
In 2015, the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report
team estimated that the cost of achieving the key
SDG 4 targets, that is, ensuring universal pre-primary,
primary and secondary education by 2030 in low- and
lower-middle-income countries, would cost a cumulative
USD 5.1 trillion, equivalent to about USD 340 billion per
year from 2015 to 2030. In relative terms, the total cost
would have to increase from 3.5% to 6.3% of GDP between
2012 and 2030 (UNESCO, 2015). The model did not attempt
to cost the achievement of at least a minimum level of
proficiency in reading and mathematics, mainly because
there are no established models that associate the impact
of a dollar spent in education on learning outcomes.
In 2020, maintaining most of these assumptions,
the estimates were updated to take into account progress
achieved to date. The cumulative cost of achieving
SDG 4 by 2030 in low- and lower-middle-income countries
remained the same, but the annual financing need
was increased from USD 340 billion to USD 504 billion,
mainly because of the shorter time frame. Of that, only

331

C H A P T E R 2 2 • F inance

USD 356 billion would be covered by available domestic
financing resources, increasing the annual financing gap
from USD 39 billion to USD 148 billion, or from 12% to
29% of the total cost (UNESCO, 2020). Adding to the
lower-than-expected progress and the shorter time frame,
four other factors accounted for the increased financing
gap: lower-than-expected GDP growth in low-income
countries; a slight increase in the projected numbers of
students by 2030; updated classroom construction cost
parameters; and faster-than-expected convergence
towards pupil/teacher ratio targets. However, this financial
gap excluded the potential cost implications of COVID-19,
for which separate calculations were made.
There is an annual financing gap of almost USD 100 billion
As noted, this updated edition of the costing model
focuses on the cost of achieving the targets that countries
have set for 2030, which fall short of the universal global
SDG 4 aspiration. A few other assumptions have also
been revised, notably those related to the calculation of
classroom costs (Table 22.1). The costing model covers the
period 2023–30 and has been calculated for the 79 lowand lower-middle-income countries classified by the World
Bank in 2019. Figures are expressed in constant 2019 USD.
While post-secondary education costs are recorded, they
are not included in the costing model, which would add
about 0.8% of GDP to current education budgets.
IMF projections for GDP are used for each year up to
2026; beyond then, GDP is assumed to grow at the
average rate of the last three years in each country.
IMF projections are also used for tax revenue as a share of
GDP up to 2026; beyond then, tax revenue is expected to
grow at a decreasing rate from the starting values
(e.g. by 1 percentage point per year if they are between
10% and 12.5% of tax revenue as a share of GDP but by
0.5 percentage points per year if they are between 20% and
25%). Similar assumptions are used for the share of
education in the budget.
A portion of ODA by DAC member countries is already
directed to government budgets: it is assumed that
60% of ODA to education should be deducted from each
recipient country’s public education expenditure. It is
further assumed that ODA will remain constant until 2030,
based on recent trends, at just over 0.3% of GNI. The model
also assumes that about 8% of total ODA is allocated to
education or 10% of the ODA that is allocated to specific
sectors. Finally, DAC donor allocations per low- and
lower-middle-income country in 2016–19 are assumed to
be replicated up to 2030.

Achieving the national targets in low- and lowermiddle-income countries will cost a cumulative
USD 3.7 trillion between 2023 and 2030, or USD 461 billion
per year on average. Of that, the average annual cost will
be USD 52 billion in low-income and USD 408 billion in
lower-middle-income countries. This averages out to
USD 97 billion per year. The cost of pre-primary education
will more than triple during the period.

Despite optimistic budget projections, many countries will
not manage to increase their budgets sufficiently because
of low tax revenues. As a result, the annual average
financing gap between 2023 and 2030 is estimated to be
USD 97 billion, or 21% of the total cost of achieving the
national targets. The average gap is USD 26 billion (50% of
the total cost) in low-income countries and USD 71 billion
(17% of the total cost) in lower-middle-income countries.
(Table 22.2a). This annual financing gap is equivalent to
2.3% of GDP during the period (Table 22.2b).

Sub-Saharan African countries represent half of the
low- and lower-middle-income countries (41 out of 79)
but account for the largest share of the financing gap:
USD 70 billion per year on average. While the annual
average total budget is expected to increase from 3.4% of
GDP in 2023 to 4% by 2027 and 4.6% by 2030, it remains
limited due to the low tax base, which accounts for only
20% to 25% of total government spending, and falls short
of meeting the growing financing needs. As a share of GDP,
the total cost is expected to increase from an average
of 5.7% in 2023 to 7.4% in 2027 and 9.7% in 2030 – and
11.9% if post-secondary education financing needs are also
taken into account. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest
education exclusion rates, with 20% of primary school-age
children and almost 60% of upper secondary school-age
youth not in school.

Compared to the 2015 costing model, with an annual
average cost of USD 340 billion between 2015 and
2030, the 2023 model has an annual average cost of
USD 461 billion, even though the financing gap doubles
to an average gap of USD 97 billion. As a share of GDP,
the 2015 model predicted a cost increase from 3.5% to
6.3% between 2012 and 2030, while the 2023 model
predicts an increase from 5.4% in 2023 to 7.9% in 2030.
The increase is explained by the fact that slow past
progress implies a much faster increase in student
and teacher numbers, even though the targets are
more modest.
Compared to the 2020 costing model, with an estimated
annual average cost of USD 504 billion between 2020 and
2030, the 2023 costing model has both a lower estimated
cost and a lower financing gap despite the shorter
time frame, thanks to the less ambitious nature of
the targets. Based on estimates made before the
COVID-19 pandemic, the model predicted that domestic
financing could cover USD 356 billion of the total annual
financing need, which is almost the same as the average
financing capacity of low- and lower-middle-income
countries predicted for the period 2023–30.

The number of teachers in the model is about equal to the
number of students per level of education divided by the
pupil/teacher ratios. In total, it is estimated that 5 million
more teachers will be needed between 2023 and 2030 for
low- and lower-middle-income countries to achieve their
targets in pre-primary, primary and secondary education.
Pre-primary education will bear the brunt of this increase:
relative to the 2023 baseline, the number of pre-primary
educators needs to triple in low-income countries and
double in lower-middle-income countries by 2030.
Additionally, the number of primary school teachers will
need to increase by nearly 50% in low-income countries in
the same period.
As the assumptions have made clear, the model focuses
on the essential needs for low- and lower-middle-income
countries to accelerate their progress and set them on
course to achieving SDG 4. Arguably, this is not enough,
as the world is changing rapidly. Digital transformation
is one of the additional demands that education systems
need to engage with. But there are formidable cost
implications and real trade-offs facing governments and
development agencies.
CAN COUNTRIES AFFORD THE COST OF DIGITAL
TRANSFORMATION IN EDUCATION?
The cost of achieving the SDG 4 targets that low- and
lower-middle-income countries have set for themselves
is beyond reach. This is despite the fact that the level
of ambition in this costing exercise has been lowered,
substituting the unachievable targets of universal
pre-primary, primary and secondary education with
the relatively more realistic national benchmarks that
reflect countries’ own education sector plans. This
costing exercise did not include countries’ post-secondary
education ambitions. But it did consider other government
aspirations, such as the digital transformation of their
education systems.
The cost of digital transformation in education should be
put into context and its components unpacked. Doing so
does not imply that countries have to shoulder these costs.
As this report has argued at great length, the adoption of
education technology cannot follow a blanket approach.
It must be appropriate to particular contexts, compatible
with equity and inclusion objectives, commensurate
to scaling potential, and mindful of long-term adverse
consequences. This costing exercise contributes to the
discussion on the current cost implications of scaling
up education technology investments, should such
investments be included in education sector plans.

Proponents of investment in education technology have
put forward three arguments for including education
technology at the expense of other education system
priorities. First, the adoption of education technology is
inevitable, given how technology is permeating all aspects
of social and economic life – a valid point, even if it mainly
relates to teaching about technology (for which investment
does not need to be large-scale) rather than teaching
through technology. Second, the adoption of education
technology is necessary to build system resilience, as the
experience of the COVID-19 pandemic shows. However,
that experience is rare enough that it cannot justify such
a massive investment, except possibly for countries and
contexts more vulnerable than average to emergencies.
Third, and most critically, it has been argued that using
new technology will increase education system efficiency
to such an extent that it will be possible to do more
with less resources, for example, through replacing less
effective teachers, accessing learners whose marginal cost
to reach is well above average or personalizing teaching.
While this argument has merit, there is no evidence that
this is now happening, except perhaps in parts of higher
education or where radio and television have matured as
technologies in specific contexts. The conditions are simply
not yet in place to allow economies of scale. If anything,
in the short- to medium-term, such investment would
basically displace other necessary investments, such as
making classrooms conducive to learning, filling teacher
gaps and ensuring every student has a textbook. In the
analysis that follows, it is therefore assumed that any such
investment would be additional. The level of investment
in low- and lower-middle-income countries would be so
high that policymakers would need to think extremely
carefully before committing to costs that would inevitably
benefit few learners and do nothing to help the education
of disadvantaged populations.
Three transformation scenarios and four types of cost have
been calculated
The range of potential investments under the umbrella of
digital transformation is extensive. This analysis was built
on three scenarios of progressively increasing ambition
and complexity. The first scenario (basic offline) involves
some digital teaching and learning opportunities in schools,
with shared devices. All schools will have power, even if
not connected to the grid, but there will be no internet
connection beyond levels currently available. The second
scenario (fully connected schools) involves some tailored
digital learning, still shared – but more – devices, and fully
electrified and connected schools. The third scenario
(fully connected schools and homes) involves a scenario
not unlike what the world’s richest countries experienced

2 0 2 3 • G L O B A L E D U C AT I O N M O N I T O R I N G R E P O R T

334

22

during COVID-19 with tailored digital learning in schools
and at home and the universal availability of devices,
electricity and internet connectivity.
As these scenarios indicate, four major components
of digital transformation of an education system were
analysed with assumptions based on the literature and
discussions with experts (Table 22.3). This breakdown
of cost items follows a model developed by UNICEF
(Yaoi et al., 2021). First, preparing systems for digital
learning involves content development, teacher training,
student and family engagement, capacity for data use
at national and school level, and capacity for policy
development. For instance, teachers will need to be
trained, both initially and on an ongoing basis, while
schools will need to be equipped with devices and
capacities for managing and using data.
Second, devices would need to be distributed to
students and teachers: it is assumed that there would
be 10 students sharing a device under the basic offline
scenario and 5 under the fully connected schools scenario,
before switching to a one-to-one ratio under the fully
connected schools and homes scenario. One-to-one
ratios for teachers would apply for the last two scenarios.
Devices would be replaced every five years, with the
cost varying from USD 100 per device in low-income
countries in the basic scenario to USD 400 per device in
middle-income countries in the latter two scenarios.
Third, the cost of internet connectivity was incorporated
under the second and third scenarios. Under the second
scenario, one-off cost assumptions to connect an average
school (USD 15,000) were based on the Giga project,
excluding some of the most remote schools, which it
would take millions of dollars to connect. Under the third
scenario, it was assumed that the cost would be equivalent
to 90% of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
estimate of the cost of universal connection for all those
age 10 and older to 4G or the equivalent, including mobile
infrastructure, fibre, network operations, remote area
coverage, policy and additional digital skill training
(ITU, 2021). On top of these costs, it is necessary to add
the operational cost of paying for data consumption
both at school (for both scenarios) and at home.
The home-based scenario is predicated on the Alliance
for Affordable Internet estimate that the cost of 1 GB
of mobile broadband should be no more than 2.45% of
monthly income to meet the affordability criterion in lowand lower-middle-income countries.
Fourth, progressively ambitious assumptions under each
scenario relate to electrification. Under the basic offline
scenario, all remaining schools would get power through

335

C H A P T E R 2 2 • F inance

solar panels. Under the fully connected schools scenario,
all schools would be connected to the grid at a fraction of
the cost that it takes to connect households. Under the
fully connected schools and homes scenario, all homes
would be connected through a mix of solar, microgrid and
grid supply. Electricity use costs were calculated based on
levels of consumption and specific assumptions on prices.

The cost of digital transformation need not
exclusively be a burden on the education
ministries’ budget
Many of these assumptions are difficult to specify with
precision: it depends on how targets are defined, on the
price level at the time the estimate is made and on the
reference period considered. In the case of internet
connectivity, for example, the UN estimated that the cost
of connecting the remaining 3 billion people to the internet
by 2030 would be USD 428 billion (ITU, 2020). In contrast,
a consulting firm estimated a figure five times as high –
or USD 2.1 trillion – only cutting the current connectivity
gap by half by 2025 but increasing the percentage of
high-speed internet users from 53% to 80% (Rastogi et al.,
2020). Even these estimates may only partially address
some of the cost elements required to support digital
learning. Still, the cost of digital transformation need
not exclusively be a burden on the education ministries’
budget; some of the costs may even be undertaken outside
of governments, for instance, investments in connection
to the internet. However, identifying financing sources and
mechanisms is beyond the scope of this analysis.
The cost of digital transformation is well beyond poor
countries’ reach
The cost of achieving digital transformation varies widely
between the three scenarios (Table 22.4). In the case of
the basic offline scenario, the capital expenditure adds
up to USD 67 billion, of which USD 52 billion is spent in
low- and lower-middle-income countries. The operational
expenditure amounts to USD 13 billion on average, to be
spread across 7 years, of which USD 10 billion would have
to cover costs in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
Under the fully connected schools scenario, the capital
expenditure increases to USD 225 billion, of which
USD 183 billion is for low- and lower-middle-income
countries. The operational expenditure will add up to
USD 188 billion, again spread across 7 years, of which
USD 112 billion would have to cover costs in low- and
lower-middle-income countries.

Finally, under the fully connected schools and homes
scenario, the capital expenditure increases to
USD 1.4 trillion, of which more than USD 1 trillion is for
low- and lower-middle-income countries (Figure 22.12).
This is basically the cost estimated by the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (Yao et al., 2021). However,
the operational expenditure adds up to USD 558 billion,
spread across 7 years, of which USD 338 billion would have
to cover costs in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
This is 10 times higher than the operational expenditure of
USD 46 billion envisaged in the UNICEF model.
The relative weight of each cost item varies by scenario
and between country income groups. Under the basic
offline scenario, teacher preparation takes up about 30% to
40% of the total cost, while the cost of introducing data
and analytics rises from 20% in low-income to 54% in
upper-middle-income countries. The cost of electrification
through solar panels is one quarter of the total in
low-income countries (Figure 22.13).

Under the second scenario, universal school connectivity
and electricity account for about one fifth each of the total
cost of digital transformation, while devices for students
account for one third in low- and lower-middle-income
countries. By contrast, content development costs,
including teacher preparation, account for 60% of the total
capital cost in upper-middle-income and almost 90% in
high-income countries.
Finally, under the third scenario, the distribution of
the various capital cost items is more equal between
country income groups. Electricity accounts for about
one quarter and internet connectivity for a little over
one quarter of the total cost of digital transformation.
However, devices for students account for 40% in lowand lower-middle-oncome countries but only 20% in
high-income countries.
As the pace of adoption of education technology
accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital learning

at the Transforming Education Summit in September
2022. Governments do not want to be excluded from the
changes that new technologies are bringing to economies
and societies; many believe they can leapfrog some of the
challenges that have marred their development in the past.
Understanding the cost implications of bringing forward
digital transformation in education – as well as which
elements are transformative – is a key current policy issue.
The analysis presented in this section suggests that
supporting digital learning at home is well out of lowand lower-middle-income countries’ reach. One working
hypothesis is that by 2030, low-income countries could
aspire to achieve the first, basic offline scenario, while
lower-middle-income countries could work towards the
second scenario of fully connected schools. The implication
is that these countries would need to spend USD 21 billion
per year between 2024 and 2030 for capital expenditure.
In addition, operational expenditure would increase by
USD 12 billion per year. The combined cost, when added
to the financing gap which low- and lower-middle-income
countries are already facing to reach their national
SDG 4 benchmarks, would increase their financing gap by
50% (Figure 22.14).

HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE
The 2021/22 GEM Report estimated that in the average
country, households contribute 30% of total education
spending, a factor that contributes to increasing education
inequality as some households cannot afford to spend out
of pocket. But household finances have been adversely
hit by the global economic slowdown caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Per capita income was expected to
fall by nearly 5% below pre-pandemic levels in 2023
(World Bank, 2022a). The war in Ukraine further
contributed to increased inflation, hitting low- and
middle-income countries hard (Gill and Nagle, 2022).
High energy prices and food market volatility are putting
additional economic pressure on households. The Food and
Agriculture Organization’s Food Price Index was 30% higher
in April 2022 than the same month in 2021. Prices of items
like cereals, meat, milk, eggs and cooking oil have been on
the rise across markets in many countries (Jaramillo and
Taliercio O’Brien, 2022; Kanamugire, 2022). The UN Special
Crisis Task Force reported that more than 60 countries
faced challenges in paying for food imports (NEPAD and
WFP, 2022; Wax, 2022). An additional 75 to 95 million
people were expected to fall back into extreme poverty by
2022 (Mahler et al., 2022).

School feeding programmes are widespread globally, with
125 out of 139 low- and middle-income countries having at
least one major programme in 2021 (Global Child Nutrition
Foundation, 2022). Many low-income countries have
adopted school feeding as part of multisectoral strategies
incorporating health and agriculture (Alderman and Bundy
2012; Drake et al. 2017). In 2020, these programmes cost
a total of USD 35.3 billion, reaching at least 330 million
children, or 27% of primary and secondary school children.
The share of children benefiting from school feeding
programmes ranges from 10% in low-income to 47% in
high-income countries. Most programmes in low- and
middle-income countries focus on primary schools and
target children living in areas with food insecurity. Overall,
governments are the primary source of school meal
finance but aid accounts for three quarters of funding in
low-income countries (WFP, 2020) (Figure 22.15). Despite
the coverage of these programmes, some 73 million
children still need food assistance (Cupertino et al., 2022).
An additional USD 5.8 billion is estimated to be required,
with some USD 3 billion needed in low-income and USD
2.7 billion in middle-income countries (Drake et al., 2020).

F I G U R E 22. 15:

As poor families in low- and middle-income countries
face the burden of meeting basic food needs, school
feeding programmes have emerged as a crucial social
protection intervention. They provide in-kind benefits to
families, which can add up to 15% of household income
in low-income areas (Bundy et al., 2018; Verguet et al.,
2020). School meals serve as a powerful incentive for
parents to send their children to school, improving access
and participation. Moreover, they enhance learning
outcomes by providing macro- and micronutrients, leading
to significant gains in height, weight and the number of
school days attended (Aurino et al., 2020; Cohen et al.,
2021; Kristjansson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021;
Zar et al., 2020).
The median cost of school feeding in low- and
middle-income countries is USD 30 per child per year,
but this ranges from USD 10 in India to USD 270 in
Botswana (Kristjansson et al., 2016). In Africa, USD 22 is
spent per beneficiary child per year, ranging from
USD 16 in low-income to USD 56 in middle- and
high-income countries (Wineman et al., 2022)

Building national capacity, resilience and social
protection is critical for ensuring that school feeding
becomes a national responsibility. From 1970 to 2013,
38 programmes initially supported by the World Food
Programme (WFP) transferred policy ownership to the
government (Permanent Mission of France, 2021).

as firewood and a small payment for cooks (WFP, 2019b).
In recent years, the government has committed to expand
the programme’s reach and ensure its sustainability.
In 2021, it allocated USD 109 million to support school
feeding and other nutrition interventions
(Ethiopia News Agency, 2023).

Armenia launched its school feeding programme in
2010, beginning with the most deprived areas and
later expanding to all provinces. School feeding is now
included in the national planning process. Since 2013,
the government has been financing the transportation,
storage and handling costs of the project administered by
the WFP through an established trust fund. Starting with
the 2014/15 school year, the government took over
the school feeding programme in 3 of 11 provinces
(Sarr and Karanovic, 2016); by 2017/18, it accounted for
38% of funding.

Cambodia’s school meals programme was funded by
donors for several years. Following the adoption of
homemade school meals in the National Social Protection
Policy Framework 2016–25, the National Social Protection
Council under the Ministry of Economy and Finance
established the programme within the national budget
from 2019/20 onwards (WFP, 2019a).

Brazil’s National School Feeding Programme is a federal
school feeding programme that is mainly financed by
public funds and is available free of charge to all students
in all types of public schools enrolled at all levels of basic
education and youth and adult education (Cupertino et al.,
2022). It supports 44 million students per year (Silva
et al., 2023) and is administered by the National Fund for
Educational Development and the Ministry of Education.
In 2022, the federal government provided about BRL
3.1 billion (USD 0.6 billion), which is just under a quarter of
the BRL 15 billion that the federal government transfers
monthly to beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia programme,
Brazil’s social security programme (Brazil Government,
2023; Cristóvão, 2023; Draibe, 2014; OAE
and FINEDUCA, 2022; Silva, 2021).
In Cabo Verde, school feeding began in 1979. In 2010,
the national programme, which had been funded by
the WFP since its inception, became the first national
programme in western Africa to be fully owned and
operated by the government. The programme covers
788 schools and supports almost 90,000 pre-primary,
primary and secondary school students; in 2020/21, 92% of
schools received government support, covering 64% of
primary and secondary school students (WFP, 2022).
Ethiopia’s school feeding programme is a joint effort
between the WFP, the Federal Ministry of Education
and the regional bureaux of education. Parents and local
community members also contribute in-kind items such

Nigeria’s National Own School Feeding Programme is part
of a social investment programme to address poverty,
hunger and unemployment. It has been fully funded by the
national government and operating nationwide since 2016.
It operates in 31 of Nigeria’s 36 states and feeds nearly
9.5 million students in more than 56,000 public schools,
making it the largest programme of its kind in Africa. It is
managed by the Social Investment Programme Office
in the Office of the Vice-President in collaboration with
the education, agriculture, health, budget and national
planning, justice, and women's ministries (WFP, 2019a).
Among the 125 countries with school feeding programmes,
69% have a dedicated line item for school feeding in the
budget. The coverage rate is on average 19 percentage
points higher in South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific
and 16 percentage points higher in sub-Saharan Africa
for countries with such a line item, which allocate a
larger budget per beneficiary child than those without.
For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, countries with a line
item have a budget of USD 46 per child, while countries
without a line item have a budget of USD 23.50 per child
(Global Child Nutrition Foundation, 2022).
Besides the different financial costs, the level of
administrative involvement of local government in school
feeding budget allocation varies. In Mali, the government
channels funds through the Ministry of Finance to regional
offices, which send funds to district-level communes.
The communes then purchase food at local markets,
and after ensuring adequate school infrastructure, school
management committees transport the food to schools
(Nafula, 2015). In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Education
manages school meals, transferring resources from

22

the central government to caterers facilitated through
zonal education offices, which also oversee programme
implementation (WFP, 2019a). In Tunisia, the School
Services Directorate of the Ministry of Education is
responsible for the programme's operating costs, including
food procurement.
In contrast, other countries have opted for direct budget
transfers from the central government to school caterers
or local governments. The Nigerian government transfers
financial resources directly to over 100,000 cooks across
the country, with cooks responsible for purchasing
ingredients at local markets and preparing them in
schools (WFP, 2019a). Kenya has implemented the Home
Grown School Feeding model, which sources local food
to keep costs down and support agricultural production.
The Ministry of Education transferred a fixed budget
of USD 0.05 per child per day directly to a dedicated
school bank account for food procurement and made
the school committee responsible for purchasing the
food (Masset and Gelli, 2013). The budget allocated for
the feeding programme in 2023/24 is KSH 5 billion (USD
35 million), 0.8% of the education budget (Muchunguh,
2023). In Tunisia, the Ministry of Education manages the
programme’s budget and infrastructure, with regional
antennae of the Office of School Services transferring
resources to schools for food purchase and programme
implementation (WFP, 2019a).

School meal budgets may not increase
proportionately with rising food prices

School meal budgets may not increase proportionately
with rising food prices. The average budgets did not change
between 2013 and 2020, resulting in many governments
being forced to curtail provision (CBS, 2022). In Malawi,
the Home Garden School Feeding Scheme was difficult
to implement, as inflation caused payments to farmers
to be lower than the costs of provision (Brigham and
Haug, 2022). Price increases also lead to the purchase
of ultra-processed foods. A study in Brazil showed that
from 2008 to 2010, the prices of healthy, nutritious
foods rose faster than those of ultra-processed foods.
Moreover, the average price of ultra-processed foods was
30% to 40% lower than the price of unprocessed foods or
minimally processed foods (Teo, 2018) (Chapter 12).

In response to the 2007–08 financial crisis, the World
Bank established the Global Food Crisis Response Program
(GFRP), which provided a total of USD 1.2 billion to
49 affected countries, including Benin, Kyrgyzstan,
Sierra Leone and Yemen (World Bank, 2022b). Some
countries received budget support in the form of loans.
However, an evaluation criticized the low number of
grants for international development a
 ssociation target
countries under the GFRP, less than USD 11 million per
country, and the high number of grants for four countries –
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Philippines and the United
Republic of Tanzania (IEG, 2014).
In response to the latest food price crisis, GPE announced
almost USD 1 million in grants for school feeding in
Senegal (GPE, 2021b). In Benin, the President, with the
support of the WFP, committed to increasing the national
budget for the school meals feeding programme from
USD 79 million to USD 240 million by 2027 (ReliefWeb, n.d.;
2022). While emergency loans for low-income countries
focus on social protection programmes, they also stipulate
requirements for government budget cuts and pay freezes
that may ultimately affect school feeding.
Some countries have responded to the food price crisis
by increasing school meal funding. Nigeria announced an
increase to per-meal funding from USD 0.09 to
USD 0.13 and so will be spending about USD 1.3 million
daily to feed an estimated 10 million children (Nnodim,
2022). In Rwanda, an additional USD 4.4 million was
allocated in the 2021/22 supplementary budget to cover
outstanding school meal payments, as parents pay for
school meals (Kanamugire, 2022).
In high-income countries, strict means testing has come
under scrutiny, as families are increasingly unable to
afford to pay for school lunches. In the United Kingdom,
an estimated 80,000 children who do not meet the
government’s free school meal eligibility criteria are unable
to pay for school meals (Phillips, 2022). In the
United States, 1.54 million pupils cannot afford school
meals but do not qualify for discounted school meals,
according to the School Lunch Debt database (Education
Data Initiative, 2021). The US Department of Agriculture
added an estimated USD 750 million to school meals
programmes nationwide, meaning schools will receive an
additional USD 0.25 per lunch to counter higher food costs
and other issues (Mackey, 2022).

STATISTICAL TABLES1
Table 1 presents basic information on demographic and
education system characteristics as well as on domestic
education finance. Tables 2–7 are organized by each of
the seven Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 targets
(4.1–4.7) and three means of implementation (4.a–4.c).
The tables mainly focus on the SDG 4 monitoring
framework of 44 internationally comparable indicators:
12 global and 32 thematic indicators. An additional
indicator, ‘Proportion of children/young people prepared
for the future, by sex’, is the product of the two global
indicators of SDG target 4.1. The tables also include
additional indicators, which are not formally part of the
SDG 4 monitoring framework, such as transition from
primary to secondary education and student mobility.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
Most data in the statistical tables come from the UNESCO
Institute for Statistics (UIS). Where the statistical tables
include data from other sources, these are mentioned in
footnotes. The most recent UIS data on pupils, students,
teachers and education expenditure presented in the
tables are from the March 2023 release and refer to
the school year or financial year ending in 2021.2 These
statistics refer to formal education, both public and
private, by level of education. The statistical tables list
209 countries and territories, all of which are UNESCO
Member States or associate members. Most report their
data to the UIS using standard questionnaires issued
by the UIS itself. For 46 countries, education data are
collected by the UIS via the UIS/OECD/Eurostat (UOE)
questionnaires.3

POPULATION DATA
The population-related indicators used in the statistical
tables, including enrolment ratios, number of out-of-school
children, adolescents and youth, and number of youth
and adults, are based on the 2019 revision of population
estimates produced by the UN Population Division.
Because of possible differences between national
population estimates and those of the United Nations,
these indicators may differ from those published by
individual countries or by other organizations.4 In the
2019 revision, single year age data are not provided
for countries with a total population of less than
90,000. For these countries, as well as some special
cases, population estimates are derived from Eurostat
(Demographic Statistics), the Secretariat of the Pacific
Community (Statistics and Demography Programme)
or national statistical offices.
ISCED CLASSIFICATION
Education data reported to the UIS are in conformity with
the International Standard Classification of Education
(ISCED), 2011 revision. Countries may have their own
definitions of education levels that do not correspond
to ISCED 2011. Differences between nationally and
internationally reported education statistics may be due
to the use of nationally defined education levels rather
than the ISCED level, in addition to the population issue
raised above.

1 The statistical tables are accessible on the GEM Report website at: https://en.unesco.org/gem-report/statistical-tables.
2 This means 2020/21 for countries with a school year that overlaps two calendar years and 2021 for those with a calendar school year. The most recent reference
year for education finance for the UOE countries is the year ending in 2019.
3 The countries concerned are most European countries, non-European Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and a changing
set of other countries.
4 Where obvious inconsistencies exist between enrolment reported by countries and the United Nations population data, the UIS may decide not to calculate or
publish enrolment ratios for some or all levels of education.

ESTIMATES AND MISSING DATA

REGIONAL AND COUNTRY INCOME GROUPS

Regarding statistics produced by the UIS, both observed
and estimated education data are presented throughout the
statistical tables. The latter are marked with subscript (i).
Wherever possible, the UIS encourages countries to make their
own estimates. Where this does not happen, the UIS may make
its own estimates if sufficient supplementary information is
available. Gaps in the tables may arise where data submitted
by a country are found to be inconsistent. The UIS makes every
attempt to resolve such problems with the countries concerned,
but reserves the final decision on omitting data it regards
as problematic. If information for the year ending in 2021 is
not available, data for earlier or later years are used, and are
indicated by footnotes.

In terms of regional groups, the statistical tables use the
SDG regional classification of the United Nations Statistical
Division, with some adjustments. This classification includes
all territories, whether independent national entities or parts
of larger entities. However, the list of countries presented in
the statistical tables includes only full UNESCO Member States
and associate members, as well as Bermuda and the Turks and
Caicos Islands, both of which are non-member states that were
included in the statistical tables of the Education for All Global
Monitoring Report. The UIS does not collect data for the Faroe
Islands, so this territory is not included in the GEM Report,
despite its status as a UNESCO associate member. In terms
of country income groups, the statistical tables use the World
Bank groups, which are updated each year on 1 July.

AGGREGATES
Figures for regional and other aggregates represent either
sums, the percentage of countries meeting some condition(s),
medians or weighted averages, as indicated in the tables,
depending on the indicator. Weighted averages take into
account the size of the relevant population of each country,
or more generally of the denominator in case of indicators that
are ratios. The aggregates are derived from both published
data and imputed values, for countries for which no recent data
or reliable publishable data are available. Aggregates marked
with (i) in the tables are based on incomplete country coverage
of reliable data (between 33% and 60% of the population [or
aggregate denominator value] of a given region or country
grouping). GEM Report calculated sums are flagged for
incomplete coverage if less than 95% of the population of a
given region or country income group is represented among the
countries for which data are available.

Percentage of qualified classroom teachers
Qualified teachers are defined as those who have the minimum academic qualification necessary to teach at a specific level of education according to national standards.

E

Teacher attrition rate
Number of teachers at a given level of education leaving the profession in a given school year, expressed as a percentage of teachers at that level and in that school year.

F

Relative teacher salary level
Teacher salary relative to other professionals with equivalent academic qualifications. Data refer to actual salaries of all teachers relative to earnings for full-time, full-year workers with tertiary education
(ISCED 5 to 8). The indicator is defined as a ratio of salary, using annual average salaries (including bonuses and allowances) of teachers in public institutions relative to the wages of workers with similar
educational attainment (weighted average) and to the wages of full-time, full-year workers aged 25 to 64 with tertiary education.

G

Percentage of teachers who received in-service training in the last 12 months
For data representative of teachers at a level of education or grade, the proportion of teachers that have received in-service training in the past 12 months (or time period available in the dataset). For
data representative of students’ teachers, the proportion of students’ teachers that have received in-service training in the past 12 months (or time period available in the dataset). For cross-national
assessments with more than one assessment in the same level of education, the average of all grades is used.

at his school in Melong, in the West of
Cameroon.

He says: “I’m not familiar with internet.
I only use it at my phone. For research.
It would be good if we had internet and
computers at school. I can then adapt
my lessons. It would be more practical,
and children can learn and understand
better. Coaching for the teachers would
be welcome then, because it will be a
different way of teaching.”*

Aid tables
INTRODUCTION
Data in the following four tables on official development
assistance (ODA) are derived from the International
Development Statistics (IDS) database of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The IDS database records information provided annually
by all members of the OECD Development Assistance
Committee (DAC), as well as a growing number of non-DAC
donors. Figures for ODA come from the DAC database,
while figures for aid to education come from the Creditor
Reporting System (CRS), a database of individual projects.
Figures in the DAC and CRS databases are expressed in
constant 2021 US dollars. The DAC and CRS databases are
available at: www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.htm.
In 2019, the methodology of defining ODA changed:




The cash-flow approach, used for Tables 2-4, includes
both grants and loans that (a) are undertaken by
the official sector; (b) have promotion of economic
development and welfare as their main objective; and,
for loans, (c) are at concessional financial terms (having a
grant element of at least 25%).
The new grant-equivalent approach, which is used for
Table 1, counts only grants and the grant element of
concessional loans as ODA.

Multilateral donors are international institutions with
government membership that conduct many or all of
their activities supporting development and aid recipient
countries. They include multilateral development banks
(e.g. World Bank, regional development banks), United
Nations agencies and regional agencies.




AID RECIPIENTS AND DONORS
The DAC list of ODA recipients consists of all low- and
middle-income countries, based on the World Bank
income classification. For further information, see:
www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainab
le-development/development-finance-standards/
historyofdaclistsofaidrecipientcountries.htm.

Multilateral flows refers to bilateral donor contributions
pooled with other contributions and disbursed at the
discretion of the multilateral donor to fund its own
programmes and running costs.

For a list of bilateral and multilateral donors, see the
‘Donors’ worksheet at: https://webfs.oecd.org/oda/
DataCollection/Resources/DAC-CRS-CODES.xls

TABLE 1: DEVELOPMENT AND
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE
ODA comprises bilateral and multilateral development
assistance, both sector allocable and non-allocable
(e.g. general budget support, humanitarian aid, debt relief).
ODA disbursements are reported as follows:


The DAC glossary of terms and concepts is available at:
www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/
development-finance-data/dac-glossary.htm.

Bilateral flows refers to bilateral donors contracting with
multilateral donors to deliver a programme.



Total ODA


As volume, in million US dollars



As a share of gross national income (GNI)

Contributions to multilateral donors (a subset
of total ODA)


As volume, in million US dollars



As a share of total ODA disbursements.

Reported humanitarian assistance is a subset of total ODA
from the OECD CRS database.

Bilateral donors are countries that provide development
assistance directly to recipient countries. Most are DAC
members. Bilateral donors also contribute substantially to
the financing of multilateral donors through contributions
recorded as multilateral ODA.

TABLES 2 AND 3: DEVELOPMENT
ASSISTANCE TO EDUCATION BY DONOR
AND BY RECIPIENT

TABLE 4: DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
TO EDUCATION BY DONOR – TOP 3
RECIPIENTS

Direct aid to education is aid reported in the CRS database
as direct allocations to the education sector. Four
education levels are distinguished:

This table reports the amount and share of bilateral and
multilateral donor assistance to education and to basic
education allocated to the top 3 recipients of assistance
from each donor.









Basic covers primary education, basic life skills for youth
and adults, and early childhood education.
Secondary covers general secondary education and
vocational training.
Post-secondary covers tertiary education as well as
advanced technical and managerial training.
Level unspecified refers to any activity that cannot be
attributed solely to the development of a particular level
of education, such as education research and teacher
training. General education programme support is often
reported in this subcategory.

Total aid to education adds to direct aid a component of
general budget support (i.e. aid provided to governments
without being earmarked for specific projects or sectors).
It is reported as follows:








Total aid to education is direct aid to education plus 20%
of general budget support.
Total aid to basic education is direct aid to basic education
plus 50% of ‘level unspecified’ and 10% of general budget
support.
Total aid to secondary education is direct aid to secondary
education plus 25% of ‘level unspecified’ and 5% of
general budget support.
Total aid to post-secondary education is direct aid to postsecondary education plus 25% of ‘level unspecified’ and
5% of general budget support.

The share of education in total ODA is calculated using total
ODA as reported in Table 1.

Technology in education:
A TOOL ON WHOSE TERMS?
Technology’s role in education has been sparking intense debate for a long time.
Does it democratize knowledge or threaten democracy by allowing a select few
to control information? Does it offer boundless opportunities or lead towards a
technology-dependent future with no return? Does it level the playing field or
exacerbate inequality? Should it be used in teaching young children or is there a risk to
their development? The debate has been fuelled by the COVID-19 school closures and
the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.
But as developers are often a step ahead of decision makers, research on education
technology is complex. Robust, impartial evidence is scarce. Are societies even asking
the right questions about education before turning to technology as a solution? Are
they recognizing its risks as they seek out its benefits?
Information and communication technology has potential to support equity and
inclusion in terms of reaching disadvantaged learners and diffusing more knowledge in
engaging and affordable formats. In certain contexts, and for some types of learning,
it can improve the quality of teaching and learning basic skills. In any case, digital
skills have become part of a basic skills package. Digital technology can also support
management and increase efficiency, helping handle bigger volumes of education data.
But technology can also exclude and be irrelevant and burdensome, if not outright
harmful. Governments need to ensure the right conditions to enable equitable access
to education for all, to regulate technology use so as to protect learners from its
negative influences, and to prepare teachers.
This report recommends that technology should be introduced into education on
the basis of evidence showing that it would be appropriate, equitable, scalable and
sustainable. In other words, its use should be in learners’ best interests and should
